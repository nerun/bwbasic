   who assisted in the development Unix installation and configuration
   for this version.


1. DESCRIPTION


   The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large superset 
   of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) and a significant 
   subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987), and many 
   classic BASIC dialects in C.  

   bwBASIC can be configured to emulate features, commands, functions 
   and operators available in many classic dialects of BASIC interpreters;
   these are controlled by the various commands.  bwBASIC does not 
   attempt bug-level compatibility with any particular BASIC dialect nor 
   does it currently support graphics.  bwBASIC seeks to be as portable 
   as possible.

   The interpreter is fairly slow.  Whenever faced with a choice
   between conceptual clarity and speed, I have consistently chosen the 
   former.  The interpreter is the simplest design available, and 
   utilizes no system of intermediate code, which would speed up 
   considerably its operation.  As it is, each line has only one 
   command.  Multi-statement lines are internally broken into distinct 
   lines as they are loaded.


2. TERMS OF USE:


   This version of Bywater BASIC is released under the terms of the 
   GNU General Public License (GPL), which is distributed with this 
   software in the file "COPYING".  The GPL specifies the terms under 
   which users may copy and use the software in this distribution.

   A separate license is available for commercial distribution,
   for information on which you should contact the author.


3. QUICK REFERENCE LIST OF COMMANDS, FUNCTIONS AND OPERATORS

   
   The OPTION VERSION command selects a specific BASIC dialect.
   A BASIC dialect is a selection of commands, functions, operators 
   and behaviors from a collection of over 500 such items.
   Additional OPTION commands are used to fine-tune the behavior.

   Note that any function can be executed as a command.  For example, 
   the function "OUT(X, Y)" can be executed as the command "OUT X, Y". 
   You can overload functions by parameter signature (the number
   and types of parameters), and user defined functions can replace
   any instrinsic function, including INP, OUT, PEEK, POKE, and WAIT.

4. GENERAL NOTES ON USAGE:


   4.a. Interactive Environment

   An interactive environment is provided if the flag INTERACTIVE
   is defined as TRUE in bwBASIC.h, so that a line with a
   line number can be entered at the bwBASIC prompt and it will be
   added to the program in memory.

   Line numbers are not strictly required, but are useful if the
   interactive enviroment is used for programming.  For longer
   program entry one might prefer to use an ASCII text editor, and
   in this case lines can be entered without numbers.  See also the
   documentation below for the pseudo-command EDIT, in section 5.

   4.b. Naming Conventions

   Command, function, label, and variable names are not case sensitive,
   so that "Run" and "RUN" and "run" are equivalent. 

   Variable names can use any alphabetic characters, the period
   and underscore characters and decimal digits (but not in the
   first position). They can be terminated with the various numeric 
   type characters (!,@,#,%,&,~) or the string type character ($).
   
   4.c. Numerical Constants

   Numerical constants may begin with a digit 0-9 (decimal), with
   the "&H" or "&h" (hexadecimal) or the "&o" or "&O" (octal).
   Numerical constants may include 'E' or 'e' followed by an 
   exponent number to denote exponential notation.
   Numerical constants may also be terminated by the various numeric 
   type characters (!,@,#,%,&,~), 

   4.d. Command-Line Execution

   A filename can be specified on the command line and will be
   LOADed and RUN immediately, so that the command line

      bwBASIC prog.bas

   will load and execute "prog.bas".  If a program is executed
   from the command line, control is returned to the operating system
   when the program terminates.

   4.e. Program Storage

   All programs are stored as ASCII text files.  

   4.f. TRUE and FALSE

   TRUE is defined as -1 and FALSE is defined as 0 in the default
   distribution of bwBASIC.  Alhtough these definitions can be changed 
   by those compiling bwBASIC (see file bwBASIC.H), any other values
   are not supported.

   4.g. Assignments

   Assignment must be made to variables.  This differs from some
   implementations of BASIC where assignment can be made to a
   function.  Implication: "INSTR( 3, x$, y$ ) = z$" will not
   work under bwBASIC.  The command "MID$(X$,...) = ..." is 
   implemented and should be used instead.
   
   Some BASIC dialects allow the multiple variable assignments,
   such as:
      LET A = B = C = 0
   In bwBASIC, only the left-most '=' is considered an assignment.
   All other '=' are considered comparison operators.  To resolve
   this issue, use commas to seperate the variables, such as:
      LET A, B, C = 0
   If these statements are only used to initialize the variable
   values, then they may not needed in bwBASIC, since all numeric
   variables are initialized to zero (0) and all string variables 
   are initialized to the empty string ("").

   4.h. Operators and Precedence

   The available operators are determined by the OPTION VERSION
   setting.  bwBASIC recognizes many operators, with 
   their level of precedence given in section 9.  The precedence
   levels chosen for the various operators in bwBASIC were selected 
   to be compatible with most dialects of BASIC.  If your application
   requires a specific order of evaluation, then use parentheses.
   
   The collating sequence (ASCII, EBCDIC, and so on) is determined 
   by the C compiler.  As a consequenece, the results of string
   comparisons may vary.  A simple check for collating sequence is
   shown in the following example:
   
      100 REM Purpose: Verify collating sequence (sort order)
      110 REM  Author: Howard Wulf, AF5NE
      120 REM    Date: 2015-11-28
      130 REM
      200 IF "1" < "A" THEN 300
      210 PRINT "EBCDIC"
      220 GOTO 999
      300 PRINT "ASCII"
      999 END

   4.i. Numerical Precision (NOT)

   bwBASIC utilizes numbers with only one level of precision.
   All numbers are internally represented using a C double.
   
   The various numeric type characters (!,@,#,%,&,~), 
   just like the string type character ($), are part of the 
   variable name.
     
   This version also supports type declarations, such as:
      DIM X AS INTEGER
   and
      DEF FNA(X AS INTEGER) AS INTEGER
   Combining both a type character and a type declaration
   is not supported.
   
   Type   Equivalent
   Char   declaration
   ====   ===========
   $      STRING
   #      DOUBLE
   !      SINGLE
   @      CURRENCY
   &      LONG
   %      INTEGER
   ~      BYTE

   The type declarations are used to range-check the values.  
   This allows most programs to run correctly, but does not 
   handle all possible cases.  The current implementation is not 
   complete for all possible uses of numeric type declarations.

   In the current version, the type of numeric values is used
   to select the appropriate operation.  As a consequence, 
   integer division is used when dividing two integer values.
   The MOD and \ operators use the rounded integer values of
   their parameters and return a rounded integer result.
   
   Within an expression, the result of an operation is promoted
   to the greater of:
      the type of the left parameter,
      the type of the right parameter, and
      the type required to hold the result.

   In bwBASIC, numeric constants are DOUBLE by default.  If you
   wish to coerce a numeric constant, then add the appropriate
   numeric type character immediately after the numeric digits.
   Most BASIC dialects that allow numeric constants to have a
   numeric type character adopt this convention. 
   
   4.j. OPTION VERSION and so on
   
   OPTION commands should be specified in your "profile.bas",
   so they will be effective when your BASIC program is LOADed.

   The OPTION VERSION command selects a specific BASIC dialect.
   The current list of available OPTION VERSION values are:
      OPTION VERSION Bywater          ' Bywater BASIC
      OPTION VERSION DARTMOUTH        ' Dartmouth DTSS BASIC
      OPTION VERSION MARK-I           ' GE 265 Mainframe BASIC
      OPTION VERSION MARK-II          ' GE 435 Mainframe BASIC
      OPTION VERSION SYSTEM-360       ' IBM System/360 BASIC
      OPTION VERSION RSTS-11          ' DEC RSTS-11 BASIC-PLUS
      OPTION VERSION SYSTEM-370       ' IBM System/370 BASIC
      OPTION VERSION CBASIC-II        ' CBASIC-II for CP/M
      OPTION VERSION ECMA-55          ' ANSI Minimal BASIC
      OPTION VERSION HANDBOOK1        ' The BASIC Handbook, 1st Edition
      OPTION VERSION HANDBOOK2        ' The BASIC Handbook, 2nd Edition
      OPTION VERSION TRS-80           ' TRS-80 Model I/III/4 LBASIC
      OPTION VERSION BASIC-80         ' Microsoft BASIC-80 for Xenix
      OPTION VERSION GW-BASIC         ' Microsoft GW-BASIC for MSDOS
      OPTION VERSION ECMA-116         ' ANSI Full BASIC
      OPTION VERSION QBASIC           ' Microsoft QBASIC for MSDOS
      OPTION VERSION VBX              ' Microsoft VBX for Windows

   Depending upon the current OPTION VERSION setting, certain 
   commands, functions and operators will be enabled or disabled.
   The OPTION VERSION setting also controls the default values
   for:
        OPTION STRICT ON | OFF
        OPTION ANGLE DEGREES | RADIANS | GRADIANS
        OPTION BUGS ON | OFF
        OPTION LABELS ON | OFF
        OPTION COMPARE BINARY | DATABASE | TEXT
        OPTION BASE 0 | 1
        OPTION COVERAGE ON | OFF
        OPTION TRACE ON | OFF
        OPTION ERROR GOTO | GOSUB
        OPTION COMMENT "char"
        OPTION STATEMENT "char"
        OPTION PRINT "char"
        OPTION IMAGE "char"
        OPTION DATE "format"
        OPTION TIME "format"
        OPTION USING "magic"

   As an example of the choice of OPTION VERSION:
   "OPTION VERSION ECMA-116" makes "MOD" a function, while
   "OPTION VERSION BASIC-80' makes "MOD" an operator.
   The availability of every command, function and operator
   for each "OPTION VERSION" setting is documented in section 9.

   Because OPTION VERSION changes how programs are parsed, it should be executed 
   before a BASIC program is LOADed.  The proper place to set OPTION VERSION is 
   in "profile.bas", before any other desired OPTION commands.  Note the
   version name is not quoted.
      
   Additional commands allow you to configure the available commands, 
   functions and operators to support existing BASIC programs.  They allow you
   to configure bwBASIC to support many different flavors of BASIC.

   OPTION COMMENT is provided to allow you to change the comment character.
   For example, if your existing BASIC program uses the exclamation-point as
   the comment character instead of the apostrophe, then add OPTION COMMENT "!"
   to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.  

   OPTION IMAGE is provided to allow you to change the image character.
   For example, if your existing BASIC program uses the back-slash as
   the image character instead of the colon, then add OPTION IMAGE "\"
   to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.  

   OPTION PRINT is provided to allow you to change the print character.
   For example, if your existing BASIC program uses the pound-sign as
   the print character instead of the question-mark, then add OPTION PRINT "#"
   to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.  

   OPTION STATEMENT is provided to allow you to change the statement seperator
   character. For example, if your existing BASIC program uses the back-slash as
   the statement seperator character instead of the colon, then add 
   OPTION STATEMENT "\" to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.

   OPTION DATE is provided to allow you to change the format of DATE$.
   For example, if you existing BASIC program expects the date format to be
   yyyy-mm-dd, then add OPTION DATE "%Y-%m-%d" to "profile.bas", after the
   OPTION VERSION command.  The format is used by the C function strftime().
   
   OPTION TIME is provided to allow you to change the format of TIME$.
   For example, if you existing BASIC program expects the time format to be
   HH-MM-SS, then add OPTION TIME "%H-%M-%S" to "profile.bas", after the
   OPTION VERSION command.  The format is used by the C function strftime().

   OPTION DISABLE COMMAND is provided to allow you to disable (hide) 
   a specific command.  For example, if your existing BASIC program uses
   QUIT as a variable, then add OPTION DISABLE COMMAND "QUIT" to "profile.bas",
   after the OPTION VERSION command.  
   
   OPTION DISABLE FUNCTION is provided to allow you to disable (hide) 
   a specific function.  For example, if your existing BASIC program uses
   PI as a variable, then add OPTION DISABLE FUNCTION "PI" to "profile.bas",
   after the OPTION VERSION command.

   OPTION DISABLE OPERATOR is provided to allow you to disable (hide) 
   a specific operator.  For example, if your existing BASIC program uses
   MOD as a variable, then add OPTION DISABLE OPERATOR "MOD" to "profile.bas",
   after the OPTION VERSION command.
   
   OPTION ENABLE COMMAND is provided to allow you to enable (show) 
   a specific command.  For example, if your existing BASIC program uses
   QUIT as a command, but is otherwise ECMA-55, then add 
   OPTION ENABLE COMMAND "QUIT" to "profile.bas", after the 
   OPTION VERSION command.

   OPTION ENABLE FUNCTION is provided to allow you to enable (show) 
   a specific function.  For example, if your existing BASIC program uses
   PI as a function, but is otherwise ECMA-55, then add 
   OPTION ENABLE FUNCTION "PI" to "profile.bas", after the 
   OPTION VERSION command.

   OPTION ENABLE OPERATOR is provided to allow you to enable (show) 
   a specific operator.  For example, if your existing BASIC program uses
   MOD as an operator, but is otherwise ECMA-55, then add 
   OPTION ENABLE OPERATOR "MOD" to "profile.bas", after the 
   OPTION VERSION command.
   
   OPTION ERROR GOSUB causes the program to GOSUB to the error handler.
   The error handler should exit with the RETURN command. This option
   configures the syntax of the ON ERROR command to ON ERROR GOSUB line,
   and ON ERROR RETURN NEXT.  In the current version of bwBASIC, this
   is not the default setting for any exisiting OPTION VERSION settings.
   For example, if your existing BASIC program uses ON ERROR GOSUB,
   then add OPTION ERROR GOSUB to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION 
   command.  
   
   OPTION ERROR GOTO causes the program to GOTO to the error handler.
   The error handler should exit with the RESUME command.  This option
   configures the syntax of the ON ERROR command to ON ERROR GOTO line,
   and ON ERROR RESUME NEXT.  In the current version of bwBASIC, this
   is the default setting for all exisiting OPTION VERSION settings.
   For example, if your existing BASIC program uses ON ERROR GOTO,
   then add OPTION ERROR GOTO to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION 
   command.  
   
   OPTION LABELS OFF disables textual labels. so statements of the form 
   "label:" and "GOTO label" are disallowed.  For example, if your existing 
   BASIC program does not use textual labels, then add OPTION LABELS OFF 
   to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.  
   
   OPTION LABELS ON enables textual labels. so statements of the form 
   "label:" and "GOTO label" are allowed.  The label must be on a line 
   by itself and the label must end with the OPTION STATEMENT character.  
   For example, if your existing BASIC program uses textual labels, then 
   add OPTION LABELS ON to "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.  
      
   Regardless of the OPTION LABELS setting, statements of the form 
   "IF x THEN label" are not allowed, instead use the form 
   "IF x THEN GOTO label".  The reason is "IF x THEN y" is interpreted as:
       IF x THEN
         y
       END IF
   where "y" is a command, function, or subroutine.  Most BASIC dialects
   that allow textual labels adopt this convention.
   
   OPTION ROUND controls how floating point values are converted to
   whole number values.  OPTION ROUNG MATH rounds toward the nearest
   whole number, with halves rounding up to the next larger whole number,
   as commonly expected by most scientific applications.  OPTION ROUND 
   BANK rounds halves to the even whole numbers, as commonly expected 
   by most financial applications.  OPTION ROUND TRUNCATE truncates to 
   the next smaller whole number, as commonly expected by most 
   applications written for an integer BASIC.  The selected rounding 
   method is used whenever a whole number is required, including:
   a) selection value for ON ... GOTO and ON ... GOSUB
   b) any function parameter requiring a whole number
   c) array subscripts and dimensions
   d) string positions and lengths
   e) CINT() and similar
   The OPTION ROUND command does not change INT() or FIX().
   The default rounding method is OPTION ROUND BANK.

                                                BANK           MATH           TRUNCATE

   The OPTION BUGS command determines the behavior of a number of BASIC keywords.  
   BASIC programs which rely on these behaviors are non-portable and non-standard. 
   I have considered several different names for this command, but have not yet 
   thought of a better short name.  Because OPTION BUGS changes how programs 
   are parsed, it should be executed before a BASIC program is LOADed.  The proper 
   place to set OPTION BUGS is in "profile.bas", after the OPTION VERSION command.
      
   OPTION BUGS ON disables the ANSI/ECMA/ISO standard behavior.
   With OPTION BUGS ON:
   
   FOR ...        ' values are evaluated left-to-right
   GOTO X OF ...  ' an invalid value for X falls thru without ERROR
   GOSUB X OF ... ' an invalid value for X falls thru without ERROR
   ON X GOTO  ... ' an invalid value for X falls thru without ERROR
   ON X GOSUB ... ' an invalid value for X falls thru without ERROR
   X = VAL("X")   ' returns zero without ERROR
   INPUT X        ' empty string returns zero without ERROR
   INPUT X$       ' empty string returns ""   without ERROR
   INPUT X$       ' allows unquoted character strings
   variable names ' period and underscore are allowed
   variable types ' the type characters #!@&% are allowed
   PRINT "a" X    ' string concatenation is implied
   1.2% is 1      ' the type characters #!@&% are allowed
   1D1 is ERROR   ' 'D' is not allowed as exponent seperator
   
   OPTION BUGS OFF enables the ANSI/ECMA/ISO standard behavior.
   With OPTION BUGS OFF:

   FOR ...        ' values are evaluated according to standard
   GOTO X OF ...  ' an invalid value for X is a fatal ERROR
   GOSUB X OF ... ' an invalid value for X is a fatal ERROR
   ON X GOTO  ... ' an invalid value for X is a fatal ERROR
   ON X GOSUB ... ' an invalid value for X is a fatal ERROR
   X = VAL("X")   ' raises an illegal function call (ERROR 5)
   INPUT X        ' empty string retries input
   INPUT X$       ' empty string retries input
   INPUT X$       ' unquoted character strings retries input
   variable names ' period and underscore are not allowed
   variable types ' the type characters #!@&% are not allowed
   PRINT "a";X    ' string concatenation is not implied
   1.2% is ERROR  ' the type characters #!@&% are not allowed
   1D1 is ERROR   ' 'D' is not allowed as exponent seperator

   Conflicting and pathological OPTION combinations are not supported.

   4.k. ERROR handling
   
   bwBASIC implements a simplified error handling strategy.
   Errors are seperated into two categories:
   
   a) certain errors which could be corrected with a simple 
   error handler are trappable.  These erorrs are:
   - Out of data (ERROR 4)
      - the last DATA item has already been READ.
      - the default behavior is to terminate the program.
   - Illegal function call (ERROR 5)
      - a function's parameter's value is invalid.
      - the default behavior is to terminate the program.
   - Overflow & Division by Zero  (ERROR 6)
      - the default behavior is to display a warning message.
   - Advanced Feature (ERROR 73)
      - the function is not implemented on this platform.
      - the default behavior is to terminate the program.
   If an error handler exists, then it is executed,
   otherwise the default behaivor is performed.
   The correct action to take in an error handler
   depends upon the specific application.  
   
   b) all other errors are fatal.  These errors include:
   - Syntax Error
   - FOR without NEXT
   - NEXT without FOR
   - WHILE without WEND
   - WEND without WHILE
   - and so on.
   The program is immediately terminated.

   Previous versions of bwBASIC used ON ERROR GOSUB.
   This version defaults to ON ERROR GOTO instead,
   which could depend upon the OPTION VERSION setting.  
   One solution for older bwBASIC programs is to add
   OPTION ERROR GOSUB as the first line of the program.
   Another solution would be to add OPTION ERROR GOSUB
   to your "profile.bas" file.

   4.l.  Implementation rules for functions and commands
   
   In many BASIC dialects, there are significant differences 
   between a command and a function.  In this version of bwBASIC, 
   the following rules have been used to determine whether a 
   BASIC keyword is implemented as a command or a function:
   
   a) If the keyword requires significant parsing,
   then it is implemented as a command.  An example is "PRINT".
   
   b) If the keyword requires access to variables BYREF,
   then it is implemented as a command.  An example is "SWAP".
   
   c) If the keyword changes the flow of control,
   then it is implemented as a command.  An example is "GOTO".
   
   d) A function may be used as though it were a command, 
   but a command cannot be used as though it were a function.
   
   e) The BASIC program can redefine a function, 
   but the BASIC program cannot redefine a command.  
   
   f) The BASIC program can overload a function, 
   but the BASIC program cannot overload a command.  
   
   g) Other than semantics, there is no practical difference
   between a BASIC function and a BASIC subroutine.  The
   return value of a BASIC subroutine, when called as a
   function, is zero.
   
   These rules were chosen to allow maximum flexibility, 
   while maintaining compatibility with existing BASIC programs.
   A side-effect is that a keyword you might expect to be a 
   command may have been implemented as a function.
   
   An example of the results of the above rules is "LOCATE".  
   Since "LOCATE" is implemented as a function, you may:
   a) call it as a subroutine like this:
      100 LOCATE X, Y
   b) call it as a function like this:
      100 LET N = LOCATE( X, Y ) ' N = 0
   c) redefine it as a subroutine like this:
      SUB LOCATE( X, Y )
          REM ...
      END SUB
   d) redefine it as a function like this:
      FUNCTION LOCATE( X, Y )
          REM ...
      END FUNCTION
   e) overload it using subroutines like these:
      SUB LOCATE( X, Y )
          REM ...
      END SUB
      SUB LOCATE( X, A$ )
          REM ...
      END SUB
      SUB LOCATE( A$, X )
          REM ...
      END SUB 
      SUB LOCATE( A$, B$ )
          REM ...
      END SUB 
   f) overload it using functions like these:
      FUNCTION LOCATE( X, Y )
          REM ...
      END FUNCTION
      FUNCTION LOCATE( X, A$ )
          REM ...
      END FUNCTION
      FUNCTION LOCATE( A$, X )
          REM ...
      END FUNCTION 
      FUNCTION LOCATE( A$, B$ )
          REM ...
      END FUNCTION
   
   4.m.  Reference documentation

   bwBASIC is preconfigured to support a number of specific BASIC 
   dialects which were implemented using the following references.  
   bwBASIC attempts to be compatible with the documentation below.
   bwBASIC does not attempt to be bug-level compatible, and
   bwBASIC does not implement non-portable design choices.
   There are many other good books which describe the commands, 
   functions and operators of these BASIC dialects in detail.

5. PREDEFINED VARIABLES


   BWB.EDITOR$
   BWB.FILES$
   BWB.PROMPT$
   BWB.IMPLEMENTATION$

   The commands EDIT and FILES are pseudo-commands that launch
   shell programs named in the variables BWB.EDITOR$ and BWB.FILES$,
   respectively.  The default values for these variables can
   be changed in bwBASIC.h (DEF_EDITOR and DEF_FILES), or they
   can be changed on the fly by the user.  An idea might be to
   initialize these variables in "profile.bas" for specific
   implementations; for instance, BWB.FILES$ might be defined as
   "ls -l" on Unix systems or "dir" on DOS systems.

   The preset variable BWB.PROMPT$ can be used to set the prompt
   string for bwBASIC.  Again, it is suggested that a user-
   selected prompt can be set up in a "profile.bas" to be
   initialized each time bwBASIC starts.  Note that special
   characters can be added to the prompt string, e.g.,

      BWB.PROMPT$ = "Ok"+CHR$(10)

   will give an "Ok" prompt followed by a linefeed.

   The preset variable BWB.IMPLEMENTATION$ will return "TTY" (IMP_IDSTRING)
   for the bwx_tty implementation.  In previous versions of bwBASIC,
   the existance of the keywords CLS, COLOR and LOCATE were determined 
   at compile and BWB.IMPLEMENTATION$ was used at runtime to determine
   whether these keywords existed.  In the current version,
   these keywords always exist and are now controlled at runtime 
   using the OPTION TERMINAL commands.  With OPTION TERMINAL NONE
   these keywords output nothing.     

   
6. UNIMPLEMENTED COMMANDS AND FUNCTIONS, and AGENDA FOR DEVELOPMENT


   There are some items not implemented that have been so long
   a part of some BASICs that their absence will seem surprising.
   In each case, though, their implementation would require opera-
   ting-system-specific functions or terminal-specific functions
   that cannot be universally provided. Some specific examples:


   INP reads a value from a hardware port.  In the current version,
   using INP() will generate ERROR 73 on most platforms.  It is
   expected that you will provide a suitable implementation for your 
   specific application. For example:
       FUNCTION INP( X )
           REM Return whatever value your application requires
           INP = 0
       END FUNCTION

   OUT writes a value to a hardware port.  In the current version,
   using OUT() will generate ERROR 73 on most platforms.  It is
   expected that you will provide a suitable implementation for your 
   specific application. For example:
       SUB OUT( X, Y )
           REM do something
       END SUB

   PEEK reads a value from a memory location.  In the current version,
   using PEEK() will generate ERROR 73 on most platforms.  It is
   expected that you will provide a suitable implementation for your 
   specific application. For example:
       FUNCTION PEEK( X )
           REM Return whatever value your application requires
           PEEK = 0
       END FUNCTION
         
   POKE writes a value to a memory location.  In the current version,
   using POKE() will generate ERROR 73 on most platforms.  It is
   expected that you will provide a suitable implementation for your 
   specific application. For example:
       SUB POKE( X, Y )
           REM do something
       END SUB

   WAIT reads a value from a hardware port.  In the current version,
   using WAIT() will generate ERROR 73 on most platforms.  It is
   expected that you will provide a suitable implementation for your 
   specific application. For example:
       SUB WAIT( X, Y )
           REM do something
       END SUB
       SUB WAIT( X, Y, Z )
           REM do something
       END SUB

   DEF USR, USR and VARPTR rely on hardware-specific conventions.
   The only fix is to remove them from your BASIC program. 

   There are other commands, functions, and implementation details
   that I am working on, and which are on the agenda list for future
   versions of bwBASIC.  These agenda include:
      
   PARACT i.e., the ability to execute PARallel ACTions. This
     is described in ANSI BASIC, although I have not seen it
     implemented before.  It will offer a rough, non-
     preemptive form of multitasking within the scope
     of a BASIC program. Programmers will note points at which
     there are already hooks for PARACT in bwBASIC.
     In the interim, you might use the "ON TIMER" command to
     implement a simple multitasking BASIC program.

   XMEM  PC-type computers need to be able to use extended
     memory.  If we could use extended memory for program
     lines, variables, and function defitions, we could
     write much longer programs.  This would entail,
     however, a fairly serious rewriting of the program
     to utilize memory handles for these storage features
     instead of direct memory pointers.  In the interim,
     you might use a "DOS Extender" which hooks calloc()
     and free() to enable transparent access to EMS or XMS 
     memory.

   Windows The addition of memory handles in addition to the
     non-preemptive execution of program lines (in a
     crude form, already present) will make it possible
     to develop implementations for Windows and perhaps
     for other graphical user interfaces.  But what form
     should this take?  I have in mind presently a BASIC
     that would run in the background, appearing only
     as an icon in the GUI space, with pop-up editors
     and output windows. Thus, the interpreted language
     would serve a purpose something like 'cron' (a task
     scheduler) under Unix systems. You may have some
     reflections that would help me in this.  

   Graphics  Here we face fairly critical differences in different
     styles and implementations of graphics, e.g., between
     GWBASIC, ANSI BASIC, VisualBASIC, etc. But it's
     possible that Graphics commands and functions could
     be added.  These would all be OPTION VERSION specific.
     In the interim, you might consider using ReGIS or Tektronix
     graphics (ESC codes) with xterm.

   The ANSI Standard for full BASIC does not specify which particular
   commands or functions must be implemented, and in fact the standard
   is very robust.  Perhaps no implementation of BASIC would ever
   include all of the items, but some ANSI commands and functions which
   remain unimplemented are:

   ACCESS
   AREA
   ARRAY
   ASK
   BSTR
   BVAL
   CELLS
   CLIP
   COLLATE
   CONNECT

7. THE STORY OF Bywater BASIC


   This program was originally begun in 1982 by my grandmother, Mrs.
   Verda Spell of Beaumont, TX.  She was writing the program using
   an ANSI C compiler on an Osborne I CP/M computer and although my
   grandfather (Lockwood Spell) had bought an IBM PC with 256k of
   RAM my grandmother would not use it, paraphrasing George Herbert
   to the effect that "He who cannot in 64k program, cannot in 512k."
   She had used Microsoft BASIC and although she had nothing against
   it she said repeatedly that she didn't understand why Digital
   Research didn't "sue the socks off of Microsoft" for version 1.0
   of MSDOS and so I reckon that she hoped to undercut Microsoft's
   entire market and eventually build a new software empire on
   the North End of Beaumont. Her programming efforts were cut
   tragically short when she was thrown from a Beaumont to Port
   Arthur commuter train in the summer of 1986. I found the source
   code to bwBASIC on a single-density Osborne diskette in her knitting
   bag and eventually managed to have it all copied over to a PC
   diskette. I have revised it slightly prior to this release. You
   should know, though, that I myself am an historian, not a programmer.

9. EXPANDED REFERENCE FOR COMMANDS, FUNCTIONS AND OPERATORS

   
   bwBASIC provides a simple "HELP" command to assist you in
   finding the command or function you are looking for.
   If you do not find the command you are looking for,
   then look to see if it has been implemented as a function.

   This section provide brief descriptions of every intrinsic 
   command, function and operator available in bwBASIC; 
   it is not intented to be an exhaustive reference.

   Please refer to the reference documentation in section 4.m
   for detailed descriptions of each of the following items.

DESCRIPTION: Automatic line numbering for manual program entry.
             If the line already exists, then an asterisk is displayed and
             pressing ENTER leaves the line as-is.  If the line does not exist,
             then an asterisk is not displayed and pressing ENTER terminates
             AUTO mode.  Regardless of the line's existance, entering the
             command MAN will terminate AUTO mode.  AUTO mode is also terminated
             by any ERROR or by pressing control-C.

     SYNTAX: BREAK line [, ...]]
DESCRIPTION: Diagnostic command to stop execution at the specified
             line(s).  BREAK only applies to user-numbered lines.  For multi-statement
             lines, BREAK only applies to the first statement.  BREAK effectively
             inserts a hidden STOP command immediately after the line number.
             Once a BREAK occurrs on a specified line, it is automatically
             removed.  To remove all existing BREAKs, execute BREAK without
             any line numbers.

     SYNTAX: LSET string-variable$ = expression
DESCRIPTION: Left-aligns the value of expression into string-variable$.
             If the length of the value is too short, then it is padded on
             the right with spaces.  If the length of the value is too long,
             then it is truncated on the right.  This is only for use with
             variables assigned to a random access buffer with FIELD command.

DESCRIPTION: Opens a file for use.  INPUT, OUTPUT, and APPEND
             are for text files.  BINARY is for binary files.  RANDOM is for
             structured binary files and requires LEN.  Files opened for RANDOM
             use GET and PUT.  For CBASIC-II, this opens an existing file
             and the syntax is OPEN filename$ [ RECL reclen ] AS filenum [
             BUFF number ] [ RECS size ].

     SYNTAX: USER LBL
DESCRIPTION: An internal command that allows the BASIC program
             to find a user label.  You do not directly call this command.
             If your program has a line with a label, then USER LBL is used
             to mark the line.

     SYNTAX: S$ = CHR( X )
  PARAMETER: X  is a number
DESCRIPTION: The one-character string with the character corresponding
             to the numeric code X.  On ASCII systems, CHR(65) returns 'A'.For
             the IBM System/360 and System/370, this function returns the
             output of PRINT X, so A$ = CHR(X) is the opposite of X = NUM(A$).

             positive number representable by the implementation, and is therefor
             implementation-defined.  Note also that EPS may produce different
             results for different arithmetic options (see OPTION ARITHMETIC).

     SYNTAX: N  = VAL( A$ )
  PARAMETER: A$ is a string, LEN >= 1
DESCRIPTION: The value of the numeric-constant associated with
             A$, if the string associated with A$ is a numeric-constant. 
             Leading and trailing spaces in the string are ignored.  If the
             evaluation of the numeric-constant would result in a value which
             causes an underflow, then the value returned shall be zero. 
             For example, VAL(' 123.5 ' ) = 123.5, VAL('2.E-99') could be
             zero, and VAL('MCMXVII') causes an exception.
