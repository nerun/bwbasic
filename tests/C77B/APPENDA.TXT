     Handling the Diskettes

(1)  To load the diskette,  remove it from its protective jacket. 
     Insert  the diskette with label up and the slot exposing the 
     magnetic  surface into the drive first.  After the  diskette 
     "clicks" into place, gently close the compartment door.

(2)  Always  place the diskette back in its  protective  envelope 
     after use. NEVER place your fingers or thumb on the diskette 
     through the window slot exposing the magnetic surface.

(3)  Do  not  leave the diskette lying  around.  Dirt,  dust,  or 
     stains on the diskette could cause the loss of  data.  Never 
     leave  the  diskette  lying  on the video unit  or  near  an 
     electric motor,  since the presence of a magnetic field  may 
     also cause loss or scrambling of data.

(4)  Use  a  felt-tip pen to make any notes on the label  of  the 
     diskette.  Using  a ballpoint pen or pencil could damage the 
     diskette inside the envelope.

(5)  Never load the diskette with the disk drive off.

(6)  Never  remove the diskette from the disk  drive  compartment 
     with the red "BUSY" light on.

(7)  Never  insert a diskette into the drive before powering  the 
     drive  up;  also never power the drive down while a diskette 
     is still inserted.

(8)  Keep  the  disks stored at a temputure of 10 to  52  degrees 
     centigrade or 50 to 125 degrees fahrenheit.
