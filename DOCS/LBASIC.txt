Contained  on  your  LDOS  Master  Diskette  is  a  program  named  LBASIC/CMD
(LBASIC). As was  noted in  the GETTING  STARTED  portion of  the manual, your
computer contains two different types of  memory, ROM  (Read Only  Memory) and
RAM (Random Access Memory). Your  computer, as received from your dealer, does
contain a  ROM BASIC. This  ROM  Basic does  allow  you  some capabilities  of
programming in  the Basic language. However, ROM Basic does  not allow  you to
interface with your disk  drives when programming,  and  hence does not  fully
utilize your TRS-80 disk  system.  For  this reason, LBASIC has been  included
with your LDOS system.  LBASIC is  an  extension of ROM  Basic and  resides in
RAM. LBASIC  utilizes commands found in ROM Basic,  and  adds  commands to ROM
Basic  which will allow  you to interface your Basic  programs  with the  disk
operating  system. Because  of this, programs  and  data  files  created under
LBASIC may  be stored on  your  disk  drives. In addition, many LDOS functions
may be performed when programming in LBASIC,  without having  to return to the
"LDOS Ready" level.

This manual will detail  all enhancements to ROM Basic which  are contained in
LBASIC. Commands which are inherent in ROM Basic  will not be detailed in this
manual. Refer  to your Radio Shack owner's  manual  (Model I  Level  II  Basic
Manual  or Model III Operation  and Basic  Language  Reference  Manual) for  a
complete description of ROM Basic commands.

One  final point concerning the LBASIC manual.  It  is written as a  reference
manual  only. All commands  will be explained in  terms of  the function which
they serve. In no way will this manual  serve as  a tutorial on implementation
of these commands.  There  are many such  books currently on the  market  that
deal  with using  a "Microsoft  compatible"  disk  Basic  for  generalized and
specific applications. If you  require  tutorial aids for implementing LBASIC,
contact your computer dealer for a list of such material.

	 =============================================================


Any  or  all of  the parameters may be  specified when entering LBASIC.  If no
parameters are specified,  the default values listed in the above syntax block
will be assumed.

The  "command"  specification  is also optional.  If not specified,  you  will
enter into LBASIC, and the following lines will appear on the screen:

     LBASIC - Version 5.x.x - mm/dd/yy
     (C) 19xx by Logical Systems Incorporated

     Ready

The  "Ready" prompt will  indicate that LBASIC is  ready to accept any command
that you wish to give it.


If you have  rebooted the system, or have performed an exit from LBASIC to the
operating system  (usually  done  by  issuing a CMD"S"  command),  and wish to
re-enter LBASIC, you may enter the command:

     LBASIC *

at the LDOS Ready level. Doing so will cause  LBASIC to be re-entered, and any
program that was resident in memory  prior  to performing the exit to the LDOS
Ready level will remain intact. Be aware of the fact that if LBASIC *  is used
to  re-enter LBASIC  from  the  LDOS Ready  level,  any  commands which affect
HIGH$,  or any commands  that  utilize  memory (such  as  BACKUP and COPY) may
cause your LBASIC program to be overwritten with other  information.  For this
reason,  LBASIC * should  only  be  used as a  last  resort.  You  may perform
certain LDOS Library commands  directly from LBASIC  (using  the CMD command).
If a function cannot  be performed from  LBASIC using  the CMD  command, it is
not advised  to re-enter Basic using LBASIC * if you  have exited back to LDOS
to perform the command, as the integrity of your program will be suspect.


Example

One  of the following commands may be given if you wish to enter LBASIC in the
blocked  file  mode with 2 files open, having memory protected  up to location
6l440 (X'F000').  Also, you  wish to have the  program MYPROG/BAS loaded  upon
entering LBASIC.

     LBASIC (FILES=2,MEM=61440,BLK=ON,EXT=ON) LOAD"MYPROG/BAS"
     LBASIC (F=2,M=X'F000') LOAD"MYPROG"

Issuing either of the above two commands will  produce the  same  results. The
second command above uses the abbreviations  F and  M  for FILES  and MEM, and
also utilizes the  default "ON" for the BLK and EXT parameters.  Note that the
extension for  the program MYPROG/BAS  need not  be  specified  if  EXT is ON.
Also, realize  that for  either of  the above commands, if HIGH$ is lower than
61440  (X'F000'),  an  "Out of  Memory"  error will  occur, and  you  will  be
returned to the LDOS Ready prompt without entering LBASIC.

ABBREVIATED COMMANDS

   Each of  the  following LBASIC  commands may now be  represented  as single
   characters.  When using  a  single  character  command, the  effect will be
   identical  to  using  the  entire  word.  This  abbreviated  form  is  only
   acceptable  when typed on a command  line, not  in  a  program  line or JCL
   file.


   A  represents the command AUTO.

   D  represents the command DELETE.

   E  represents the command EDIT.

   L  represents the command LIST.

   The  following commands are  implemented by pressing the  indicated  key as
   the first character in the  command line.  No carriage return is necessary;
   the  indicated action will take place  immediately.  Note that  any of  the
   following single  key commands must  be  the first character entered  after
   the "Ready prompt" appears.

   . (period) This will perform the same function as "LIST.<ENTER>", which
	  will instruct LBASIC to list the currently active line.

   ,(comma)  This will perform the same function as "EDIT.<ENTER>", which
	  will instruct LBASIC to enter the "edit mode" for the currently
	  active line.

   <UP ARROW> This will cause LBASIC to display the next lower numbered line
	  in the program.

   <DOWN ARROW>  This will cause LBASIC to display the next higher numbered
	  line in the program.

   <LEFT ARROW>  This will cause LBASIC to display the first line of the
	  program.

   <RIGHT ARROW>  This will cause LBASIC to display the last line of the
	  program.


DEFAULT EXTENSIONS

   LBASIC  allows  you  to  utilize the default extension of /BAS when issuing
   the LOAD, RUN,  MERGE and SAVE commands. If the EXT parameter is set  to ON
   (or not specified) when  entering LBASIC, all filespecs used with the above
   commands that do not have extensions  will be assigned  the extension /BAS.
   If EXT is on and an extension  is  specified,  the extension  used  in  the
   filespec will override the default extension.


   If  EXT is  ON  and  the file  in  question has no  extension,  it  must be
   specified as "filename/"  (i.e. the  "/" will override the  extension  /BAS
   with no  extension).  If the EXT  parameter is  turned  OFF  when  entering
   LBASIC, all file extensions will have to be specified.


FILE BLOCKING

   LBASIC  provides  a  Blocked  file  mode (which  has  often  been  misnamed
   Variable Length Files).  This mode allows files with Logical Record Lengths
   (LRL) of less than 256 bytes to be created and  accessed. Any record length
   from 1 to 256 bytes will be allowed, even if the record size is not  evenly
   divisible into 256.

   All blocking  and de-blocking across "sector boundaries"  will be performed
   by  LDOS.  In this way,  user  records can span across sectors  to  provide
   maximum disk storage capacity. If  the LRL is not specified  when OPENing a
   Random file, 256 will be assumed. Note that an LRL  of 0 will signify a 256
   byte LRL.  Enhancements have  also  been made  to the allowable methods  of
   OPENing both Random and Sequential type files (See OPEN).

   If  the Blocked file mode  is ON,  each file  declared when entering LBASIC
   will take 544 bytes of memory. If the Blocked  mode is OFF,  each file will
   take 288 bytes.


LBASIC OVERLAYS

   Three overlays are present on a Master LDOS diskette. They are:

     LBASIC/OV1 - This overlay  contains  the  renumbering  program associated
     with the LBASIC CMD"N"  function. It may be killed if no renumbering will
     be done.

     LBASIC/OV2  -  This   overlay  contains   the  cross   reference  program
     associated with the LBASIC  CMD"X" function. It may be killed if no cross
     referencing will be done.

     LBASIC/OV3 -  This overlay contains the error handling  routine used with
     LBASIC, along  with  the  sort routine  used for the CMD"O" function.  It
     MUST be present when using LBASIC.


PROGRAM PROTECTION

   LBASIC  programs  may  be  protected  with an "Execute only" password. This
   means that  the  program  may be RUN,  but not  LOADed, LISTed, LLISTed, or
   otherwise examined. Any attempt to break the  program execution and examine
   the  program will cause the  program  to  be erased  from  memory, and  the
   message  "Protection has cleared  memory"  will  be displayed. The DEBUGger
   will also be disabled during program execution.


SINGLE STEPPING AN LBASIC PROGRAM

   This new feature  allows the LBASIC programmer to step through each program
   statement  singly,  with a "HOLD" after  each step. To invoke  this feature
   simply do a  normal pause (<SHIFT @>), which will cause LBASIC to go into a
   wait state. While continuing to hold  down the <SHIFT @> press  the  <SPACE
   BAR>)  and the next  LBASIC statement will execute. After execution of that
   statement the  computer  will  immediately  go  into its  wait state again.
   Holding down  the  <SPACE  BAR>  will  execute  statements  at  the  normal
   keyboard repeat rate. If you  press any key without holding down the <SHIFT
   @>,  normal  program  execution  will resume. Note  that this  feature also
   functions when listing a program.


TAPE ACCESS

   Accessing information off  of tape  will vary  depending  on  the  type  of
   machine you are using. You should follow these guidelines when  storing and
   retrieving information from tape.

   Model I users need  to disable the interrupts prior to performing tape I/O,
   and must re-establish them  after the input/output has  been  performed. To
   disable the interrupts,  use the LBASIC  command - CMD"T" -. To enable  the
   interrupts,  use the  command - CMD"R" -.  See the  LBASIC Commands Section
   for more information on these two commands.

   Model III users need  to do one of several things, depending on the type of
   tape  involved. If you are dealing with a 500 baud tape, you will  need  to
   specify the LOW parameter when entering LBASIC  (Remember, if HIGH  or  LOW
   is  not specified, the default  will be HIGH).  If  you are dealing with  a
   1500 baud tape, you  will need  to  establish the HITAPE utility.  For more
   information on HITAPE, refer to the Utilities section of the LDOS manual.


L B A S I C    C O M M A N D S

This section of the manual  will detail commands found in LBASIC which are not
included in ROM  Basic. These  commands will be listed  in alphabetical order.
For  the  novice, this type of grouping might be a bit confusing in  terms  of
when  and how  these  commands will be  used. However, for  the  person who is
somewhat  versed  in  using  a  disk  oriented  Basic,  this will  be  a  very
convenient way of locating information dealing with any LBASIC command.


&H - Hexadecimal Representation of a number

   To  represent  a  number  in  its  hexadecimal  format,  you  may  use  the
   characters - &H - as  a prefix to the number. This may be  useful  when you
   wish to  define an  address for a  user  machine  language subroutine  (see
   DEFUSR).

   One  to four  hexadecimal digits may  follow  the  &H  prefix.  Hexadecimal
   digits  consist  of  the numeric  digits  0-9,  as well as  the  alphabetic
   letters  A-F. The number  represented  using the &H prefix will  always  be
   taken as two's complement notation.


     Examples

     A=&H11    (A would be set equal to the decimal number 17).
     A=&HA9    (A would be set equal to the decimal number 169).
     A=&HF000  (A would be set equal to the decimal number -4096).


&O - Octal Representation of a number

   To represent a number in its octal format, you may  use the characters - &O
   - (or just - & -) as a prefix to the number.

   One to six  octal digits may follow the &O prefix. Octal digits  consist of
   the numeric  digits  0-7. The number  represented using the  &O prefix will
   always be  taken  as  two's complement  notation. The  largest octal number
   which may be represented is &O177777.


     Examples

     A=&O11    (A would be set equal to the decimal number 9).
     A=&170000 (A would be set equal to the decimal number -4096).

CLOSE - Close any or all open disk files

   The CLOSE command  is  used in  conjunction with the OPEN command. After  a
   file  has been opened,  it is capable of being read from and/or written to.
   To disable this read/write capability of a disk  file, a CLOSE  of the file
   must  be  done. In addition, CLOSE will update the Mod  flag,  Mod date and
   end of file marker in the directory record of that file (provided  the file
   has been written to). See OPEN for more information on file access.


   The syntax for the CLOSE command may be in one of the following formats:

     CLOSE
     CLOSE #,...,#

   The CLOSE  command issued by itself will  close  all open files.  The CLOSE
   #,...,# command will close only those files  that have been opened with the
   specified  buffer  number (where  # represents  the  buffer number used  to
   define a particular file in an OPEN statement).

   If you issue  any command which will perform  a  CLEAR (such as EDIT, CLEAR
   or  RUN), a global CLOSE will automatically be performed for  you. However,
   if you  issue  a  CMD"S", CMD"A",  or CMD"I" command,  closing of  any open
   files will not occur.  For  this reason, you should  always make sure files
   have been closed prior to exiting back to the LDOS Ready prompt.


CMD - Perform an LDOS or Special Command

   The CMD  command allows you  to perform  certain  LDOS library  and utility
   commands  without  having  to  leave  LBASIC. In  addition,  there  are  13
   distinct parameters  that may be used in  conjunction with  the CMD command
   which  will  allow you  to perform  various different functions. The syntax
   used for the CMD command is as follows:

     CMD"dos command"
     CMD"x" (Where 'x' is the letter assigned to the special command).

   We  will first  describe  how  to use the  CMD  command  to  issue  an LDOS
   command, after which we will explain the use of the 13 distinct  parameters
   with the CMD command.

CMD"dos command"

   LDOS  Library commands  and  Utilities  that  do  not affect  HIGH$ may  be
   executed  from  LBASIC  by  use  of  the  CMD"dos  command". The  following
   examples should illustrate implementation of this feature:

     CMD"DIR :0"         - Will display a Directory of the disk in drive 0.
     CMD"DEVICE"         - Will display the device table.
     CMD"LIST DAT1/SCR"  - Will list the file DAT1/SCR.
     CMD"BACKUP :0 :1"   - Will perform the designated Backup.

   After  the  desired  LDOS  function  has  been  completed, control will  be
   returned to LBASIC.  This type of  CMD command will function  whether it is
   called  from LBASIC's command line or  from within  an LBASIC  program.  If
   performed  from  within  an LBASIC program and an error occurs, or the  CMD
   command is  aborted  with  the break  key prior  to  being  completed,  the
   appropriate  error  message  will  be displayed,  or  the  message  "System
   Command  Aborted"  will  appear,  and execution  of  the Basic  program  in
   question  will be  terminated. The command may  also be contained  within a
   string variable, such as the following format:


     A$="DIR :0":CMD A$

   Approximately 4K of free memory must  be available  for these types  of CMD
   commands, or an "Out of Memory" error will occur.

     CMD"A"

   This  command  will  perform  an abnormal return  to  LDOS.  Any active  DO
   command will be cancelled.

CMD"B","switch"

   This command  will enable  or disable the <BREAK>  key, with "switch" being
   either  ON or OFF.  A  string constant or string expression may  be used to
   represent the "switch".

CMD"D"

   Turns on and enters the system Debugger.


CMD"D","switch"

   This  command  is  similar  to  the  CMD"D"  command,  with  the  following
   exceptions.  The switch  ON  will turn  on  the  system Debugger, but  will
   remain in LBASIC. Pressing the <BREAK> key (or <CLEAR> <SHIFT> <D>  keys if
   Minidos is active) will cause you to enter  the  Debugger.  The switch  OFF
   will turn off the Debugger.

CMD"E"

   This command will  return  the  last LDOS error message  encountered. If no
   error has been encountered, the message "No Error" will appear.  CMD"E" may
   be useful when you wish  to pinpoint the exact nature of an error. LBASIC's
   error dictionary is  not as extensive as  that found in LDOS, hence various
   LDOS  errors can produce the same LBASIC error message. Performing a CMD"E"
   will give you the exact error  seen by  LDOS. This  may be of use when  you
   get the LBASIC error message  "Disk full  or write protected" or "Disk  I/O
   error".

CMD"I","dos command"

   This  command functions  much the same as the  CMD"dos  command",  with the
   exception that  control will  return to LDOS  after the  "dos  command" has
   been executed.  Dos  command can be  represented as a  string constant or a
   string  expression. If  represented  as  a  string  constant,  it  must  be
   contained within quotes.

CMD"L","filespec"

   This  command  will  load  a Load Module  Format  file (a  machine language
   program)  into memory, much  the same  as  the LOAD  Library  command does.
   Filespec may be  represented  as  a string constant or a string expression.
   If represented as a string constant, it must be contained within quotes.


CMD"N"

   This command  provides you with a  program  line  renumbering function. For
   the specific  parameters involved with  this command, please  refer to page
   47 at the end of the LBASIC section.

CMD"O",number of elements to sort,first element of array to sort

   This command will allow you to sort a single dimensioned string  array. The
   sort  will  start at the  element  specified, and will  sort  the number of
   elements specified. The number of elements to be sorted must not  force the
   sort past the end of  the array. In order  to utilize the CMD"O"  function,
   the module LBASIC/OV3 must be present on a disk in the system.

     Example

     CMD"O",15,A$(10)
     X=15:Y=10:CMD"O",X,A$(Y)

   Issuing either  of the  above commands  will cause a sort to be performed
   on  the A$ array. After the sort has been  finished, elements  10-24 will
   be sorted in alphabetical order.

CMD"P",variable

   This command will return the printer status  in the variable specified. The
   variable may  be  any type,  including  a  string. The value will have  the
   bottom 4 bits stripped before being passed back to LBASIC.

CMD"R"

   Model  I  - This command enables the  interrupts.  It  should be  performed
   after  a  CMD"T"  command  has  been  issued. For more information see  the
   CMD"T" command.

   Model III - This command will turn on the clock display.

CMD"S"

   This command is the normal way to return to LDOS Ready from LBASIC.

CMD"T"

   Model  I - This  command  will disable the  interrupts. It  must  be issued
   prior to performing tape  I/O. After the tape  I/O  has been completed, the
   interrupts must be enabled with the CMD"R" command.

   Model III - This command will turn off the clock display.

CMD"X"

   This command provides you with a  program cross reference function. For the
   specific parameters involved with this command, please  refer to page 48 at
   the end of the LBASIC section.


CVD - Convert to Double Precision

   This command is used  to convert an 8 byte  string into a double  precision
   number. The 8 byte  string should be a representation of a double precision
   number  stored  in  compressed format.  This  command is used primarily  to
   uncompress double  precision values  which have been retrieved  from a disk
   file (in  essence, it performs the opposite function of  the MKD$ command).
   For  more information  on storing a double precision  number  in compressed
   format in a disk file, refer to the MKD$ command.

     Example

     A#=CVD(A$)

   In the above  example, assume that A$ is an  8 byte string which represents
   a  compressed  double   precision  number.  After  the   above  command  is
   performed,  A#  will  be set  equal  to  the  uncompressed  number  that A$
   represents.

   Realize  that  you are not  limited  in using  CVD  to assign a value  to a
   variable. The value generated  by a CVD command  may be used directly (e.g.
   PRINT CVD(A$), or IF CVD(A$)<100000 THEN GOTO 1000).

CVI - Convert to Integer

   The  CVI  command  functions  identically  to  the  CVD  command  with  the
   following  exceptions. The  CVI command will convert a two byte string into
   an integer. This two byte string should  be a representation of an  integer
   stored  in compressed  format.  CVI  performs the opposite function of  the
   MKI$ command. The value returned from the  CVI function  will be an integer
   within  the  range  of  -32768 to +32767  inclusive.  For more information,
   refer to the MKI$ command.

     Example

     A%=CVI(A$)

   In the above example, assume that A$  is a 2 byte string which represents a
   compressed  integer. After the  above command  is performed, AZ will be set
   equal to the uncompressed number that A$ represents.

CVS - Convert to Single Precision

   The  CVS  command  functions  identically  to  the  CVD  command  with  the
   following  exceptions. The CVS command will convert a four byte string into
   a   single   precision  number.   This  four  byte   string  should   be  a
   representation of  a  single  precision number stored in compressed format.
   CVS  performs   the  opposite  function  of  the  MKS$  command.  For  more
   information, refer to the MKS$ command.

     Example

     A!=CVS(A$)


   In the above example, assume that  A$ is a 4 byte string which represents a
   compressed  single precision number. After the above command is  performed,
   A! will be set equal to the uncompressed number that A$ represents.


DEF FN - Define Function

   There are many  intrinsic  functions provided for  you  in  ROM  Basic  and
   LBASIC  (i.e.  VAL,  STR$, SIN,  etc.). The  DEF FN  command allows you  to
   define your  own  functions. This  may  be of  use  when performing lengthy
   calculations at different points in your  program when you  do  not use the
   same variable names to perform these calculations.

   The syntax for the DEF FN command is as follows:

     DEF FNfunction name(parm,... ,parm)=expression

   The "function name" is the name that you will assign to  the function,  and
   has  the same  restrictions as  those  imposed  on  a  variable  name.  The
   function name  must be  of  the same type as the value to  be returned from
   the function.

   The  "(parm,.. .,parm)" is a list of variables to be passed to the function.
   The  variable  names used are  local  to the  function,  and  act  as dummy
   variables.  They will have no effect on  other  variables  in  the  program
   which  have the same name. However, they must be of  the same variable type
   as the variable represents  in the function  (i.e. string, integer,  single
   precision,  double precision). Also,  if  more than one variable  is  to be
   passed  to  the function, they  must be passed in the  same  order  as that
   defined in "(parm,.. .,parm)" (see example below).

   The "expression  represents how the variables passed  to  the  function are
   to be worked on.

   The example below will show how to define and invoke your own functions.

     Example

     This example  will show  how  to  create  a  function which  will build a
     filespec. This function will  be  passed three  variables;  the filename,
     the  file  extension,  and  the  drive specification.  It  will return  a
     filespec in  the  form  - filename/ext:d -. A DEF  FN statement to create
     such a function might take on the following format:

       DEF FNFS$(X$,Y$,Z%)=X$+"/"+Y$+":"+MID$(STR$(ZZ),2,1)

     The function  name is FS$,  and  is of string type,  since a string value
     will be returned from the function.

     Three values will be passed to the function. The  first two values passed
     will be strings, while the third value will be an integer.


     The  function  that will  be  performed is  as follows. The first  string
     passed  to the function  will have a  '/' added onto the end of it, after
     which  the extension, a  ':', and  the  drivespec will  be  added  to the
     string, respectively.

     The  following  example will illustrate how  to  invoke the  function, as
     well as changes that will occur to the variables involved.

       X$="HELLO":F$="MYPROG":E$="BAS":G%=2
       F1$=FNFS$(F$ ,E$ ,G%)
       F2$=FNFS$(E$ ,F$ ,G%)

     After  execution of the above three lines,  the following variables  will
     be assigned the following values:

       X$="HELLO"   F1$="MYPROG/BAS:2"   F2$="BAS/MYPROG:2"
       F$="MYPROG"  E$="BAS"             G%=2

     Note  that the value  of X$  does  not  change from the  calling  of this
     function.  Also note the  difference between  F1$ and  F2$. The order  in
     which variables appear when invoking the  function  determines  the value
     that will be returned from the function.

     As a final note  on  DEF  FN, the value returned from the function can be
     used directly, and does  not have to be stored in a  variable (e.g. PRINT
     FNFS$(F$,E$,G%) ).

DEFUSR - Define the entry point to a user machine language subroutine

   This  command is used  to define the  starting address  (entry point)  of a
   user created machine  language subroutine. A DEFUSR statement must  be done
   prior  to utilizing  the machine  language subroutine  via the USR command.
   The syntax for the DEFUSR statement is:

     DEFUSRn=xxxx

   where n is  a numeric constant (0-9) which is used to  identify the machine
   language subroutine, and xxxx  is the  address which  represents the  entry
   point into the machine language subroutine.

   The number assigned to the  subroutine (n) must  be the same  as the number
   used to reference the subroutine with the USR statement.

   The entry  address to the subroutine may be  a constant (i.e. a hexadecimal
   or decimal  number),  or it may be a numeric expression. Note  that if  the
   starting address  is specified as  a decimal  number, and  this  address is
   greater than 32767, it must be specified as the address minus 65536.

     Example

     Suppose you  have  a  machine  language  subroutine that has  a  starting
     address  of &HF000 (61440), and you wish  to  reference  this  routine as
     machine language subroutine number 2. To  define this  subroutine, one of
     the following commands may be given:


     DEFUSR2=&HF000
     DEFUSR2=(6l440-65536)
     DEFUSR2=(-4096)

EOF - Determine if "End of File" has been encountered

   This command is used to determine if the end  of file has been reached when
   inputting from an open disk file. It is used  primarily in conjunction with
   sequential files,  but  can  also  be  used with  random  files.  EOF  is a
   function,  and  will  return a 0  (false) if  the end of file  has not been
   reached, or  a  -1 (true) if the end  of file has been reached. It  can  be
   used with the IF statement, and  will determine the  outcome of the IF,  as
   it will return either a logical true or a logical false.

   The syntax for the EOF command is:

     EOF(#)

   where # is the buffer number used to open the file.

     Example

     Assume that you have created a  sequential file named MYDATA, and wish to
     access the information in it, but you do not know the  amount  of data in
     the file. The following program lines will  illustrate how to use EOF  to
     determine when the last piece of data has been accessed.

       1000 OPEN"I",1,"MYDATA"
       1100 IF EOF(1) THEN PRINT"ALL DATA HAS BEEN ACCESSED":END
       xxxx
       xxxx	'lines used to input and process data
       xxxx
       1500 GOTO 1100

     Notice  that the  EOF command is used prior to inputting any information.
     This  will ensure that  you will not try to  input from an empty file, or
     after the end  of file has been encountered. Either case  would result in
     an "INPUT PAST END" error.

FIELD - Partition the buffer associated with a random file

   The field  statement is  used to  partition  the  buffer associated with an
   open  random file. This partitioning allows  you to  break a record up into
   fields, where  each field denotes a particular piece of information in that
   record. The fielding of  a record determines the length of  each  piece  of
   information  in the  record, and where  this  information  will  physically
   reside in the record.

   The syntax used in the FIELD statement is:

     FIELD#,aaa AS variable1,bbb AS variable2,...,nnn AS variableN


   # is the buffer  number used in the associated OPEN  statement. It may be a
   constant, or a numeric expression. The value of this number must  be in the
   range  of 1 to the total  number  of files allocated when  entering LBASIC,
   inclusive, and must correspond to an open file.

   aaa, bbb and nnn are numeric constants or expressions denoting  the maximum
   length  (in bytes) of  the fielded variable.  The  value  of  these numeric
   constants or expressions must be in the  range of 0 to  255) inclusive,  as
   the length  of a  string  cannot  exceed 255  bytes. If denoted as  numeric
   expressions, these values must be enclosed within parentheses.

   variable1,  variable2,  and  variableN are  intermediate variables used  to
   retrieve information from and pass information to the  buffer. They must be
   string variables.


   When  information  passes between the computer  and the disk,  a  buffer is
   used  as a  temporary  storage place  for this  information. Information is
   placed  in  this  buffer  with  the  LSET  and  RSET  commands. Where  this
   information  is physically placed in the buffer is determined by  the FIELD
   statement.

   The field statement will allow  you  to  break  up  the buffer into various
   "slots",  assigning  a  variable  name  to  each   of   these  slots.  When
   information is  placed into or  accessed  from the buffer, it is done so by
   using  the variable  name  which  was  assigned to each  slot  in the FIELD
   statement.  The length  of  each of these  slots is also determined by  the
   FIELD statement. The  total number of bytes  to be fielded in a record must
   be less than or equal to the number of bytes that a record will contain.

   The following example will illustrate how the FIELD statement is used.

     Suppose  that you wish  to deal  with  a file  that will  contain records
     whose lengths will be  100 bytes. In each record, there will be  4 pieces
     of  information (fields).  Field 1  will  be 20 characters long, and will
     represent  the  name of a person. Field 2 will be 10 characters long, and
     will represent an  account number. Field 3  will  be 30  characters long,
     and will  represent address information. Field  4  will be 40  characters
     long, and will represent an account description.  The following  OPEN and
     FIELD  statements will allow you to open such a file and field the buffer
     accordingly.

       OPEN"R",1,"MYFILE/DAT",100
       FIELD1,20 AS NA$,10 AS AC$,30 AS AD$,40 AS DE$

     Using the above lines in a program will produce the following  results. A
     file by the  name of MYFILE/DAT will be opened, and records  in this file
     will have a length of 100 bytes. A  buffer for  this file  will be set up
     in memory.  The first  20 bytes  of  this buffer will represent name, and
     will be  referenced by the variable NA$. The next 10 bytes of this buffer
     will  represent the  account  number,  and  will  be  referenced  by  the
     variable AC$.  The next 30 bytes will represent the address,  and will be
     referenced  by  the  variable AD$.  The last 40 bytes will represent  the
     description, and will be referenced by the variable DE$.


   More  than  one field statement may correspond to the same buffer. Variable
   names used in a FIELD statement may only be used to pass  information to or
   retrieve  information  from  the buffer.  Using fielded variables  for  any
   other purpose will break the link  between the variable and the buffer, and
   the  variable will not be connected  to the buffer until the original FIELD
   statement  is re-executed.  For more information on  passing information to
   and retrieving information  from  the disk, see OPEN, GET, PUT, LSET, RSET,
   MKI$, MKS$, MKD$, CVI, CVS and CVD.

GET - Retrieve a record from a random file

   The GET command is  used  to  retrieve information  from a random file. The
   information that  is  retrieved is stored  in  the buffer that was used  to
   open the file. The syntax for the GET command is:

     GET#,r
     GET#

   where #  is  the buffer  number used to open the file,  and r is the record
   number  you  wish  to retrieve. Both # and r may  be  numeric constants  or
   numeric expressions.  If the  record  number  (r)  is  not  specified,  the
   computer will increment the  current record number by one,  after  which it
   will  perform a GET of  the  current record  number. If no  current  record
   number has  been established, the  computer will  perform a  GET of  record
   number one, and the current record number will be set equal to one.

     Example

     Suppose you  have opened a file and fielded the corresponding buffer. The
     buffer number used  is 3.  One of the  following GET commands may be used
     to retrieve the 17th record of the file.

       GET3,17
       N%=2:N1%=16:GETN%+1,N1%+1

     After executing one of the above statements,  record 17  of the file will
     be contained in the designated buffer, and  information dealing with this
     record  may now  be  accessed by  referencing the  variables used in  the
     FIELD statement.

INPUT# - Input information from a sequential file.

   The INPUT#  statement  is used to retrieve  information  from a  sequential
   file. The syntax used with the INPUT# command is:

   INPUT#n,variable1,.. ,variableN

   where  n   is   the   buffer   number   used   to  open   the   file,   and
   variable1,...,variableN are  the  variables  used to store  the information
   retrieved.

   Sequential  files  are  created  by specifying  an OPEN"O"/OPEN"E" command,
   followed by one or more  PRINT# commands. After a sequential file has  been
   created, the information in  it may  be accessed  by using the  OPEN"I" and

   INPUT#  commands. The INPUT# command can  be thought  of  as  performing  a
   function similar  to  the  INPUT  command,  the exception  being  that  the
   information is not entered from the keyboard. Rather, it is  retrieved from
   the  disk. Like  the INPUT command, INPUT# can only be executed from within
   a program, and cannot be executed from the Basic Ready prompt.

   The variable  types used in an  INPUT# statement  must  be the same type of
   variable used when the information was written to the  file  via the PRINT#
   command. At  least one variable  must be specified with the INPUT# command.
   If  multiple  variables are specified with the INPUT# command, they must be
   separated by commas.

   After execution of  an  INPUT#  command, the variable(s)  specified will be
   assigned values corresponding to  the data retrieved from the disk.  If you
   try to execute  an INPUT# command after  all of the data has been retrieved
   from the file, an INPUT PAST END error will be generated.

     Example

     Suppose a file  called  MYFILE/SEQ  was  created  using  the  OPEN"O" and
     PRINT# commands, and this file contains the following pieces of data:

       JONES
       THOMAS
       12
       MALE

     The following commands may be used to access this information:

       OPEN"I",1,"MYFILE/SEQ"
       INPUT#1,LN$,FN$,AG%
       INPUT#1,SE$

     After the execution of the first two commands, the file MYFILE/SEQ  would
     have  been opened for sequential input, the  variable LN$ would have been
     assigned the value "JONES", the  variable  FN$  would have been  assigned
     the value  "THOMAS",  and the  variable AG% would  have been assigned the
     value 12. Note that the  last piece  of data in  the file ("MALE")  would
     not have  been  accessed  by  either  of the first two commands. However,
     after the third  command (INPUT#1,SE$)  has been executed,  the  variable
     SE$ would be assigned a value of "MALE".

   INPUT#  deals with  data  in  a  disk  file  in a  special  way.  For  more
   information on creating sequential  files that are  accessed  by the INPUT#
   command, refer to OPEN ("0", "E" and "I") and PRINT#.


INSTR - Locate the position of a sub-string within a target string

   The INSTR command allows you to search for  a specified sub-string within a
   given  target string, and returns the position  number in the target string
   of where the sub-string was found. The syntax for the INSTR command is:


     INSTR(starting position,target string,sub-string)

   "starting position" is the point where you wish the  search to begin in the
   target  string (e.g. start  the search  from  the  third character  in  the
   target string). If not specified, starting position will default to 1.

   "target string" is the string you wish to search.

   "sub-string"  is  the  string you  wish to search  for  within  the  target
   string.

   The starting  position may  be  either  a  numeric  constant  or a  numeric
   expression, and must  represent an integer value  in the range of 1 to 255,
   inclusive. The target string and sub-string may be either string  constants
   or string expressions.

   INSTR will  begin the search of the target string  for the sub-string  from
   the  starting  position specified (if  no starting  position is  specified,
   INSTR  will  begin  the  search from the  first  character  of  the  target
   string), and will return  a  numeric value corresponding to the position in
   the  target string  of  where  the first  occurrence of the  sub-string  is
   found. If the  sub-string  is not  found  in  the target string, INSTR will
   return a 0. If the  sub-string to be searched  for  is a null string, INSTR
   will return the starting position of the search, as the  null  string  is a
   sub-set of any string.

   Other occurrences may cause INSTR to return a zero. They are:

     If the target string is a null string.

     If the  starting position is  a  number  greater than  the length of  the
     target string.

   The following example will illustrate the use of the INSTR command.

     Example

     Suppose you have the following lines in a program:

       A%="ROY IS A BOY":B$="OY":C$="ROY":D$="oy":E$="ROYIS"
       A%=INSTR(A$,C$)
       B%=INSTR(2,A$,B$)
       C%=INSTR(3,A$,B$)
       D%=INSTR(2,A$,C$)
       E%=INSTR(A$,D$)
       F%=INSTR(A$,E$)

     After executing the above  lines, the  following variables will have been
     assigned these values:

       A%=1    B%=2    C%=11    D%=0    E%=0    F%=0


     Note that the  value of E%  will  be 0. This  is  because  the sub-string
     ("oy")  is in  lower  case, and there are  no lower  case letters in  the
     target string. Also note that the value of F% will be $.  This is because
     the  string "ROYIS"  does not  appear in the  target  string (there is  a
     space between the words ROY and IS in the target string).

KILL - Kill (Remove) a disk file from the directory

   The  KILL  command will allow  you to  kill  a file from  a disk directory,
   making that file  inaccessible, and  freeing up  the space  on the diskette
   that the file consumed. The  KILL command functions identically to the LDOS
   Library command "KILL". The syntax for the KILL command is:

     KILL"filespec"

   where  filespec  is  any valid  LDOS file  specification. Filespec  may  be
   represented as a string constant or a string expression.

   Realize that if  the filespec given with the KILL  command does  not exist,
   you will get the error message FILE NOT FOUND.

     Example

     Suppose  you  wish  to  remove  the  file  MYFILE/DAT  from  the diskette
     currently in drive 1,  and free up the space consumed by that  file.  The
     following command will perform this function.

       KILL"MYFILE/DAT:1"

     Realize that after the  kill is performed, you will no longer be  able to
     access  any information  which was previously  stored  in the  file. Also
     note  that  since the filespec is being represented as a string constant,
     it must be enclosed in quotes.

			       N O T E

     When  performing a KILL of a data file, the file in question  must NOT be
     in an OPENed state. The KILLing  of  an open file may cause certain parts
     of the diskette in question to be totally inaccessible!


LINEINPUT - Input a line into one variable

   The LINEINPUT command is very similar to the INPUT  command. It  will allow
   you to input information  in from the keyboard to be stored in a  variable.
   The differences between the LINEINPUT  command and the INPUT command are as
   follows:

     No question mark will appear when the input is taken.

     Only one variable may be assigned a value.


     All characters entered before <ENTER> is pressed will  be assigned to the
     variable  specified  (i.e.  commas  and  quotes  may  be input  from  the
     keyboard, and leading spaces are not ignored).

   The syntax for the LINEINPUT command is:

     LINEINPUT"prompting message";variable

   The  prompting message is  optional; if  used, it must  be  included within
   quotes,  and  must  be separated  from the  variable by a semicolon. If the
   prompting message is not used, a semicolon cannot be  used. As  is the case
   with  the INPUT command, LINEINPUT cannot  be  issued from the  Basic Ready
   prompt.

     Example

     Suppose that you wish  to input a person's name and title into a program,
     and you  wish  to separate the  name from the title  by  use  of a comma.
     Using  the  LINEINPUT  command, you  may  now input  the  comma from  the
     keyboard  to  be taken  as part of  the  input  The  following  LINEINPUT
     command may be used to accomplish this.

       LINEINPUT"Enter Name, Title";A$

     When the  computer executes  the above  command,  you will see the prompt
     "Enter Name, Title" appear, and there will be no question mark  after the
     prompt.  The computer will now be awaiting your input. If you answer this
     prompt  by typing  in the response "JOHN JONES, PRESIDENT" , A$  will  be
     assigned  all characters that you have typed  in, prior to  pressing  the
     <ENTER> key.

LINEINPUT# - Input a line from a disk file into a variable.

   The LINEINPUT# command will allow you to input a line from a disk file into
   a variable.  It functions  similarly  to the  LINEINPUT command,  with  the
   exception being  that the input  is  taken from  the disk,  rather than the
   keyboard.

   The syntax for the LINEINPUT# command is:

     LINE INPUT#b ,variable

   where  b is the buffer number used  when  the file was opened, and variable
   is a string variable used to stored the retrieved information.

   LINEINPUT#  differs from INPUT# in  several  ways. As noted  in the  PRINT#
   command, INPUT# will read information in from  the disk until it encounters
   a comma, a  carriage  return, the end of file, or the 255th character  when
   dealing with string information. When using LINEINPUT#, commas  will not be
   taken as  delimiters of the string, and  hence may be included in the input
   from disk. The LINEINPUT#  of a  variable will  terminate when  a  carriage
   return,  the  end  of  file,  or  the  255th  character  of  a   string  is
   encountered. As is  the case  with  INPUT#,  LINEINPUT#  cannot be executed
   from the Basic Ready prompt.


     Example

     Assume the following data  is  stored  in a disk file, and  the file  has
     been opened using buffer number 1 ( <cr> represents a carriage return).

       JOHN JONES , PRESIDENT , ABC CORPORATION<cr>

     If the command LINEINPUT#1,A$ is used  to input the above information, A$
     would be assigned the value:

       JOHN JONES , PRESIDENT , ABC CORPORATION

     Realize that all  of the characters (including  the commas) would be read
     in and assigned to A$.

     If  the command INPUT#1,A$ were used instead  of LINEINPUT#, the value of
     A$ would  be "JOHN  JONES",  as INPUT#  will  read information  until  it
     encounters a comma.  For more  information on how data is  stored  on the
     disk in a sequential file, see PRINT#.


LOAD - Load a BASIC program into memory

   The  LOAD  command allows you to retrieve  a  BASIC  program that  has been
   stored on  disk, and place  it in the computer's memory  so  that it may be
   executed or edited. The syntax for the LOAD command is:

     LOAD"filespec",R

   filespec  may be represented as a  string constant or  a string expression.
   If represented as a string constant, filespec must appear within quotes.

   The R  parameter is optional;  if  used,  the program  to be loaded will be
   executed  after  it is  loaded,  and  all  open  files  will  remain  open.
   Performing  a LOAD without  the R option  will cause any  open  files to be
   closed.

   Loading  a program  will always overwrite any  program  in  memory with the
   program to  be loaded. Basic programs cannot be  concatenated with the LOAD
   command  (see MERGE  for program concatenation). The LOAD  command  may  be
   given from the BASIC Ready prompt, or can be issued from  within a program.
   If issued from within a program, the program issuing the LOAD  command will
   be overwritten  by  the  program  to  be  loaded,  and  execution  will  be
   terminated.

     Example

     LOAD"MYPROG/BAS"

     After execution of this command, any  program which was in memory will be
     replaced by the program MYPROG/BAS.


LOC - Get current record number

   The LOC  command  is used primarily with random files,  and will  return  a
   value  corresponding to the current record  number  of  the given file. The
   syntax for the LOC command is:

     LOC(#)

   where # represents the buffer  number used  to open the file in question. #
   may  be  either  a numeric  constant  or  a  numeric expression,  and  must
   correspond to an open file.

   When  a tile  is in  an  open  state,  the  computer maintains some control
   information  dealing  with that file. One  piece  of  information  that  is
   available to the user is the record  number currently being dealt with. The
   LOC  command will return the  current  record number that  the computer has
   accessed. If no record in  an open  file has been accessed, LOC will return
   the value 0.

     Example

     Suppose you have  opened a file using  buffer number 2, and  have fielded
     the buffer accordingly. If the following commands are executed:

       GET2,17
       A%=LOC(2)

     the variable A% will be assigned the value 17.

LOF - Get last record number

   The  LOF command is used  primarily  with random files,  and will  return a
   value corresponding  to  the  last  record  number  of the given file.  The
   syntax for the LOF command is:

     LOF(#)

   where # is  the buffer number used to open  the file  in question. # may be
   either a numeric constant or a numeric expression.

   The LOF command provides a means of  determining the number of records that
   have  been  written  to  a  random file.  Note  that  if  a  file  has been
   pre-created  using  the CREATE  library command,  LOF will return  a number
   corresponding to  the highest  record number actually  written  to, not the
   number of records that have been pre-created.

     Example

     Suppose  you have a file  named MYFILE/DAT, and the highest record number
     written to is record number 43. If the file has been  opened using buffer
     number  3, and has been  fielded  accordingly, the following command will
     result in the variable A% being set equal to 43.

     A%=LOF(3)


LSET - Place data into the buffer assigned to an open file

   The  LSET  command  will  allow  you  to  place  information in  the buffer
   associated  with  a  random file,  prior to  writing the information in the
   buffer  out to disk. It is used primarily in conjunction with random files.
   The syntax for the LSET command is:

     LSET fielded string variable=value

   fielded string  variable is the variable used in  the  FIELD statement that
   points to the location in the buffer where the data is to be placed.

   value is  the value that  you  wish to place  in  the buffer, and must be a
   string constant or a string expression.

   When dealing with random files, the FIELD statement  is used to set  up and
   partition the  buffer associated  with the file. String variables  are used
   in the FIELD statement to designate various  slots  for information storage
   and  retrieval  in the  buffer.  The  LSET  command  allows  you  to  place
   information in these slots in the  buffer, prior to writing the information
   out to disk.

   The LSET command will left-justify the information  in the buffer.  That is
   to say,  if  the  length of  the  string to be placed in the buffer is less
   than the length allocated for the particular slot, trailing  spaces will be
   inserted at the end  of the string in the buffer. This will make the string
   in the buffer the same length as specified in the FIELD statement.

   If  the length of the string to be LSET into the buffer is greater than the
   fielded length,  the left most part  of the  string will be  placed  in the
   buffer, and any characters to the right of  the  total allocated space will
   be truncated. See RSET to right-justify a string into the buffer.

   The commands MKI$,  MKS$, and  MKD$ are also used in  conjunction with  the
   LSET  statement.  Because   the  buffer  is  fielded  in  terms  of  string
   Variables, only string values may be LSET  into the buffer. The MKI$, MKS$,
   and MKD$ commands are  used to  change numeric data into compressed  string
   representations of numbers, and will create strings  of 2  bytes,  4 bytes,
   and 8  bytes respectively. When performing an LSET  using the MKI$, MKS$ or
   MKD$ commands, the length of the fielded  variable  to  be  LSET must be at
   least 2 bytes, 4 bytes, or 8 bytes, respectively.  For  more information on
   commands that are used with LSET,  refer to the  commands MKI$, MKD$, MKS$,
   and FIELD, and the example below.

     Example

     Suppose you  have a file called MYFILE/DAT,  and have opened  the file to
     have  record lengths of 45  bytes. In addition,  assume  that the  buffer
     corresponding  to the file  (buffer number 1) has been  fielded  with the
     following  statement,  and the variables listed below have been  assigned
     the given values:

       FIELD 1, 31 AS NA$, 2 AS A2$, 4 AS A4$, 8 AS A8$
       NM$="JOHN JONES, PRESIDENT":A2%=92:A4!=23.79:A8#=123498.63


     The LSET statements you  may use to place these  values  into the  buffer
     may look like this:

     LSET NA$=NM$
     LSET A2$=MKI$(A2%)
     LSET A4$=MKS$(A4!)
     LSET A8$=MKD$(A8#)

     The  values of  the variables  A2%,  A4!, and  A8# will be stored in  the
     slots  in the  buffer  pointed  to  by  the variables A2$,  A4$, and A8$,
     respectively. They  will be stored  as  compressed string representations
     of the values the variables have been assigned.

     The value  of NM$ will be stored in the slot in the buffer pointed to  by
     the variable NA$. Realize that since the length of  NM$ is 21 characters,
     the last 10 characters  of the slot in the buffer  pointed to by NA$ will
     be spaces (CHR$(32)). If the length of NM$  would  have been  longer than
     31 characters, the left-most 31 characters would have  been placed in the
     buffer,  and  the  remaining  characters would  have  been  truncated (in
     essence, ignored).

     The  LSET command will typically be used prior to performing a data write
     to a random  file. For more information on  performing a data  write to a
     random file, see OPEN, FIELD and PUT.


MERGE - Merge a program from disk with current program in memory

   The MERGE command  will allow you to  merge a  program file  stored on disk
   (in ASCII) with  a  program  resident in memory, with the resultant program
   being stored in memory. The syntax for the MERGE command is:

     MERGE"filespec"

   where filespec  represents  a BASIC  program stored  on disk  in ASCII (For
   more information on storing  BASIC programs on disk  in ASCII,  see  SAVE).
   Filespec may be represented  as a string  constant or a string  expression.
   If represented as  a  string constant,  filespec must  be  contained within
   quotes.

   The MERGE command will  read in (line by line) the  program  from disk, and
   merge  these lines in with the  existing  program. Any  line number  in the
   program  to be merged that does not exist in the  program in memory will be
   added  to the program  in memory. Any  line  number  in  the program to  be
   merged that does exist in the program in  memory will overwrite the line in
   memory.

   The MERGE command provides for an easy  way  to merge subroutines which are
   common  to  several  different programs into these  programs without always
   having  to  type in  the subroutine. The following  example will illustrate
   how the MERGE command functions.


     Example

     Suppose you have a program which is  resident in memory, and this program
     consists of the following statements:

       10 FOR L=1TO100
       20 PRINT L
       30 NEXT L

     Assume  also that you have a  program named NYPROG/ASC stored in ASCII on
     disk, and this program Consists of the following statements:

       5 DEFINT A-Z
       10 FORL=1TO500
       25 'THIS LINE HAS BEEN MERGED IN
       40 GOTO 10

     If you wish to merge  the program  MYPROG/ASC  with the program currently
     in memory, you may do so by issuing the following command:

       MERGE "MYPROG/ASC"

     By giving  the above  command, the  program  resident in  memory  will be
     changed to the following:

       5 DEFINT A-Z
       10 FORL=1TO500
       20 PRINT L
       25 'THIS LINE HAS BEEN MERGED IN
       30 NEXT L
       40 GOTO 10

     Before  merging in a program, you  should make sure that there  is enough
     free memory for the  program to be merged in. Also,  note  that the MERGE
     command  is  usually issued from  the BASIC  Ready  prompt.  However,  if
     incorporated within a program,  the MERGE will  be done, but execution of
     the program will cease.

MID$= - Replace a portion of a string

   The MID$= command   will allow you  to  perform a character   for character
   replacement of any  characters within a string.   MID$=  is the only  BASIC
   function which may  be used on the  left-hand  side of the equal  sign. The
   syntax for the MID$= command is:

     MID$(string value,starting position,length)=replacement string

   "string value" may  be either a string constant or a string expression, and
   represents the target string for the replacement.

   "starting position  is the  place in the string value where the replacement
   is  to  start.  This  may  be  either  a  numeric  constant  or  a  numeric
   expression.


   "length"  is the number of  characters  to be changed. This may be either a
   numeric   constant  or  a  numeric  expression.  The  length  parameter  is
   optional;  if  omitted,  the number  of characters to be  replaced  will be
   determined by the replacement string.

   "replacement string" is  the  string  you  wish  to replace  the  specified
   portion of  the  current string with. This may be either a  string constant
   or a string expression.

   The MID$= command will perform a  character for character  replacement on a
   given string with the replacement  string. It may not be  used to  lengthen
   or  shorten an  existing string. If the  length parameter is not specified,
   the number  of characters involved in the replacement will be determined by
   the length of  the replacement string. If the length parameter differs from
   the length of the replacement string, one of several things may happen.

   If the  length parameter is less than the length of the replacement string,
   the  length parameter will take  precedence, and only the  left-most number
   of characters as specified in the length parameter will be changed.

   If  the length  parameter is greater than  the  length  of the  replacement
   string,  the  replacement  string  will  take precedence,  and  only  those
   characters specified in the replacement string will be changed.

   If the parameters  specified  in the MID$= command would cause the original
   string to  become  larger,  only  those characters up  to the  end  of  the
   original  string  would  be changed,  and the length of  the  string  would
   remain unchanged.  In essence,  the  extra characters  at  the end  of  the
   replacement string would be ignored.

   The following example should clarify how the MID$= command functions.

     Example

     Suppose you  have a string variable  A$ set equal  to  the value "THIS IS
     IT". The following MID$= commands would have these affects on A$.

     MID$(A$,3,2)="AT"       ---> A$ would change to "THAT IS IT"
     MID$(A$,6,2)="WAS"      ---> A$ would change to "THIS WA IT"
     MID$(A$,3,8)="AT'S IT"  ---> A$ would change to "THAT'S ITT"
     MID$(A$,9,3)="ALL"      ---> A$ would change to "THIS IS AL"


MKD$ - Change a numeric value into an 8 byte compressed string

   The MKD$  command (MaKe  Double  precision  string)  will  change a numeric
   value into an  8 byte string  which  is a compressed representation of  the
   value. This  command  is used  primarily with the LSET and RSET commands to
   place numeric data into the  buffer  associated  with an  open random file.
   The syntax for the MKD$ command is:

     MKD$(numeric value)


   where  numeric value  may  be  either  a  numeric  constant  or  a  numeric
   expression. Numeric value can represent any value which may  be assigned to
   a  double  precision  variable.  Up  to  16  significant  digits   will  be
   maintained.  To convert an 8  byte  compressed string  representation of  a
   number back to a numeric value, use the CVD command.

   Since only  strings may  be stored in  the buffer  associated with  an open
   random file, there  exists  a need  to  change  numeric  data into a string
   form. MKD$ provides a way to change numeric data into  a string. The string
   formed by  MKD$ will always be 8 bytes in  length, regardless of the actual
   value to be converted. The resultant  string value obtained when performing
   an MKD$  command will be the compressed form of a number, contained in an 8
   byte  string. After  a numeric  value  has  been  changed  into  an  8 byte
   compressed string, it may then  be  placed  into a buffer via  the LSET and
   RSET  commands. (Note: This is  not  the same as the  STR$  command, as the
   STR$   command   produces  an   ASCII  string,  not  a   compressed  string
   representation of a number.)

     Example

     Suppose you have opened and fielded a  random file, and wish  to place  a
     double  precision  value  into the  buffer. The fielded variable you  are
     dealing  with is A8$, and the value you wish  to place in the part of the
     buffer pointed to by A8$ is  contained in the variable A8#. The following
     command  will cause  an 8  byte compressed  string representation of  the
     value  stored  in A8#  to be written to the portion of the buffer pointed
     to by A8$.

       LSET A8$=MKD$(A8#)

     Note that  the fielded length  of  the variable  A8$  must  be at least 8
     bytes, and in most cases will be exactly 8 bytes.

MKI$ - Change a numeric value into a 2 byte compressed string

   The MKI$ command (MaKe Integer string) will change  a  numeric value into a
   2  byte  string  which is  a  compressed  representation of the value. This
   command is used primarily with the LSET and  RSET commands to place numeric
   data into the buffer  associated with an open random file.  The  syntax for
   the MKI$ command is:

     MKI$(numeric value)

   where  numeric  value  may be  either  a  numeric  constant  or  a  numeric
   expression. Numeric  value  must be  within the range of  -32768 to +32767,
   inclusive. If numeric value is not an  integer, any numbers to the right of
   the decimal point will be truncated.  To convert a 2 byte compressed string
   representation of a number back to a numeric value, use the CVI command.

   Since only strings may be  stored  in  the buffer associated  with an  open
   random  file,  there  exists  a need  to change numeric data into  a string
   form. MKI$ provides a way to change numeric data into  a string. The string
   formed by MKI$  will  always be 2 bytes in length, regardless of the actual
   value to be converted.


   The resultant string  value obtained when performing an  MKI$ command  will
   be the compressed form of an  integer, contained in a  2 byte string. After
   a numeric value has been changed  into a 2  byte  compressed string, it may
   then be placed into  a buffer via the  LSET  and RSET commands. (Note: This
   is not the same as the STR$ command, as the STR$ command  produces an ASCII
   string, not a compressed string representation of a number.)

     Example

     Suppose you have  opened and fielded a  random file, and wish to place an
     integer value into the buffer. The  fielded variable you are dealing with
     is  A2$,  and  the value you wish to place  in  the  part of  the  buffer
     pointed to  by  A2$  is contained  in  the  variable A2%.  The  following
     command  will  cause  a 2  byte compressed string  representation  of the
     value stored in A2% to be written  to  the portion of  the buffer pointed
     to by A2$.

       LSET A2$=MKI$(A2%)

     Note that  the fielded  length of the variable  A2$  must be at  least  2
     bytes, and in most cases will be exactly 2 bytes.


MKS$ - Change a numeric value into a 4 byte compressed string

   The  MKS$ command  (MaKe  Single  precision  string)  will change a numeric
   value into a 4 byte  string which is  a compressed  representation  of  the
   value.  This command is used primarily with  the LSET and  RSET commands to
   place  numeric data into  the buffer associated  with  an open random file.
   The syntax for the MKS$ command is.'

     MKS$(numeric value)

   where  numeric  value  may  be  either  a  numeric constant  or  a  numeric
   expression. Numeric value can represent any value which may be  assigned to
   a  single  precision  variable.  Up  to  6  significant   digits   will  be
   maintained. To convert a 4 byte compressed representation  of a number back
   to a numeric value, use the CVS command.

   Since only  strings may be  stored in the  buffer associated with  an  open
   random  file,  there exists a  need  to change numeric data  into a  string
   form. MKS$ provides a way to change numeric data into a string. The  string
   formed by MKS$  will always be 4  bytes in length, regardless of the actual
   value to be  converted. The resultant string value obtained when performing
   an MKS$ command will be the  compressed form of  a number, contained in a 4
   byte string.  After  a  numeric value  has  been  changed  into  a  4  byte
   compressed  string, it  may then be placed into  a buffer via  the LSET and
   RSET commands.  (Note: This is not the  same as the  STR$  command, as  the
   STR$  command  produces   an  ASCII   string,   not  a   compressed  string
   representation of a number.)


     Example

     Suppose  you have opened and fielded a random file,  and wish to place  a
     single precision value into the  buffer.  The  fielded  variable  you are
     dealing with  is A4$, and the value you wish to place  in the part of the
     buffer pointed to by A4$ is contained  in the variable A4!. The following
     command  will  cause a  4 byte  compressed  string representation of  the
     value stored in  A4! to be written to  the  portion of the buffer pointed
     to by A4$.

       LSET A4$=MKS$(A4!)

     Note  that the  fielded length of  the variable A4$ must  be at  least  4
     bytes, and in most cases will be exactly 4 bytes.

OPEN - Open a random/sequential disk file

   The OPEN command  allows you to open random/sequential data files in  order
   that input/output  may occur between the  computer and the given file.  The
   general syntax for the OPEN command is:

     OPEN"file type",buffer number,"filespec",record length

     "file  type"  is  the  type  of file  you  wish to  deal with (random  or
     sequential).  It may be  represented as a string constant enclosed within
     quotes, or as a string expression.

     "buffer number" is the number of the  buffer  you  wish to use to perform
     the input/output from/to the  disk. This may be either a numeric constant
     or a numeric expression, and must be an  integer  value within  the range
     of  1 to the total number of active files declared  when entering LBASIC,
     inclusive.

     "filespec" is the name,  extension, password and drive number of the file
     to be opened. Filespec must conform  to all of the  rules  governing LDOS
     filespecs.  It  may  be  represented as  a  string constant  or  a string
     expression.

     "record length" pertains to  random files  only, and will  determine  the
     record length  used when accessing the file. It must be an integer value,
     and may  be  represented  as  either  a  numeric  constant, or  a numeric
     expression whose value must be in the range of 0  to 255, inclusive. This
     parameter  is optional;  if not used, record length will default to  256.
     If record length is specified as 0, it will be assumed to be  256. If the
     parameter  BLK=OFF is  specified  when  entering  LBASIC,  record  length
     cannot be specified in an OPEN statement, and will default to 256.

     Note:  Devices  may be substituted for files when  using  an  OPEN"I"  or
     OPEN"O" command. Opening devices  is an advanced  feature of  LBASIC, and
     is only  mentioned here  as  an  additional  implementation of  the  OPEN
     command.


   In  order  to write information to  and  retrieve  information from a  disk
   file,  the file  must be opened using  the  OPEN command. The  OPEN command
   establishes  the capability of  reading from and writing to a  disk file by
   creating a file  control block (FCB). This FCB  contains information needed
   by the  computer, so that the computer  may interact with the disk file. In
   addition, the  OPEN command  establishes a  buffer  which  is used  by  the
   computer as  a  temporary  storage place for  information  that  will  pass
   between the computer and the disk file.

   There are two types of files available to you  when  storing information in
   a disk file; sequential files and random files.

   Sequential  files  are  file  types  that  allow for  accessing data  in  a
   specified sequence. That is to say, if you  wish to retrieve the 10th piece
   of information in  a file, you  must  read in the nine data items preceding
   the item in question before it may be accessed.

   Random files are file types that allow you to  directly access any piece of
   information in  a file, regardless of  the physical  location of  the  data
   within the file.

   It is beyond  the scope of this manual  to discuss the  techniques involved
   in creating and accessing information in random  and sequential files. What
   will be provided for  you here is  the syntax  needed to open  all types of
   random  and  sequential files.  For the novice,  it is strongly recommended
   that supplementary material  be obtained for the purpose of learning filing
   techniques.

			 I M P O R T A N T    N O T E

   It is strongly advised that  no data  file be in an open state at any given
   time using  more than one buffer. LBASIC will  allow you  to open the  same
   file  at the same time using more than one buffer;  however,  this practice
   may lead to the destruction of data files on the diskette in question!!

   Opening sequential files.

   There  are two basic modes available for use  when  dealing with sequential
   files; the  input mode, and the  output mode.  The following list shows all
   of  the different  OPEN  commands that may  be  issued  when  dealing  with
   sequential files.


     OPEN"I"    --> Open an existing sequential file for input

     OPEN"O"    --> Open a sequential file for output
     OPEN"OO"   --> Open an existing (old) sequential file for output
     OPEN"ON"   --> Open a non-existing (new) sequential file for output

     OPEN"E"    --> Open for output and extend a sequential file
     OPEN"EO"   --> Open for output and extend an existing sequential file
     OPEN"EN"   --> Open for output and extend a non-existing sequential file


   The input mode of sequential files allows you to input  information from an
   existing file. No output to the file may be done if  it has been opened for
   input. The file to be opened for input must  exist, or the OPEN"I"  command
   will  return  a  FILE  NOT  FOUND  error.  Once the file  has been  opened,
   information may be  retrieved from  it  using  the  INPUT#  and  LINEINPUT#
   commands.

   The  output  mode of  sequential files allows  you to output information to
   the file.  No input from the file may  be done if it has  been  opened  for
   output.  Once the file  has been opened, information  may be written out to
   it using the PRINT# command. There are six types of output  modes available
   for use with sequential files.

     The OPEN"O" output  mode functions  in the following manner. If  the file
     opened  does not exist,  it  will be  created,  and  information  will be
     written  to the file starting at the first  byte of the file. If the file
     opened does exist, any  information previously stored in the file will be
     lost,  as the new information  to be placed in  the file  will be written
     over the existing information, starting at the first byte of the file.

     The OPEN"OO"  output mode  functions in the following manner. If the file
     opened does not exist, a FILE NOT FOUND error will  be generated, and the
     file will  not be created. If  the file  opened does exist, OPEN"OO" will
     function  identically to  OPEN"O" in the  case  where  the  file  already
     exists.

     The OPEN"ON" output mode functions in the  following manner.  If the file
     already exists, you will not be  allowed to open  the file, and the error
     FILE ALREADY  EXISTS will  be generated. The  existing  file  will not be
     altered in any way.  If the file does not exist, it will be  created, and
     information will be written to the file  starting  with the first byte of
     the file.

     The OPEN"E" output  mode functions in  the  following manner. If the file
     does  not exist,  OPEN"E"  will  function  identically to OPEN"O". If the
     file already  exists, the  file  will be opened, and any information that
     will be  written to the file will be appended to the end of the  existing
     information.  The file will  be  extended to include both the old and the
     new information.

     The OPEN"EO" output mode functions in the  following manner. If the  file
     does  not exist,  a FILE  NOT FOUND error will be generated,  and no file
     will be created. If the file  already  exists,  the file will  be opened,
     and any information that will be written  to the file will be appended to
     the end  of  the  existing information.  The  file  will be  extended  to
     include both the old and the new information.

     The OPEN"EN" mode functions identically to the OPEN"ON" output mode.

   Example - Opening sequential files

     Suppose that  you wished  to  open  a  sequential  file named MYDATA/SEQ,
     using  buffer number  1.  The  statement used to open  the file for input
     would be as follows:


       OPEN "I",1,"MYDATA/SEQ"

     If you wished to  open the same file  for output using buffer number two,
     one  of the following commands could be used, depending on whether or not
     you request that the file be a new file or an old  file, and  whether  or
     not you wish to extend the file:

       OPEN"O",2,"MYDATA/SEQ"
       OPEN"OO",2,"MYDATA/SEQ"
       OPEN"ON",2,"MYDATA/SEQ"
       OPEN"E",2,"MYDATA/SEQ"
       OPEN"EO",2,"MYDATA/SEQ"
       OPEN"EN",2,"MYDATA/SEQ"


   Opening random files

   Unlike sequential  files, when dealing  with  a  random file,  you have the
   capability of  reading from  and writing to  the file  using only one  OPEN
   command. The statements  PUT  and GET differentiate between writing  to the
   file  and reading from  the  file, respectively. There are  three different
   types of OPEN statements that may be executed when opening  a random  file.
   They are:

     OPEN"R"   --> Open a random file whether or not it exists.
     OPEN"RN"  --> Open a random file only if it does not exist.
     OPEN"RO"  --> Open a random file only if it already exists.

   The OPEN"R"  mode functions  in  the following  manner. The file  specified
   will be  opened  whether it exists or not, and will  be  created if it does
   not  exist.  After the file  has been opened, the buffer used  in  the OPEN
   statement may be fielded using the  FIELD  statement, and  records may then
   be retrieved from or placed into the file via the PUT and GET statements.

   The OPEN"RN"  mode functions in the following  manner.  If the file already
   exists,  you  will  not be  allowed  to  open  it.  The  file  will  remain
   untouched,  and the error FILE ALREADY EXISTS will occur. If  the file does
   not  exist,  it  will be created, and the OPEN"RN" command will function in
   the same manner as the OPEN"R" command.

   The OPEN"RO" mode functions in the following manner.  If  the file does not
   exist, no file will be created, and the error FILE  NOT FOUND  will  occur.
   If  the  file  does  exist,  OPEN"RO" will  function in the same  manner as
   OPEN"R".

     Example - Opening random files

     Suppose  you wish  to  open a random file  named MYDATA/RND, using buffer
     number  3, with record  lengths of 52 bytes.  One  of  the following OPEN
     commands  may  be used  to  open  the  file, depending  on  the  specific
     requirements needed by the  user (i.e. open the file only  if it does  or
     does not exist).


       OPEN"R",3,"MYDATA/RND",52
       OPEN"RN",3,"MYDATA/RND",52
       OPEN"RO",3,"MYDATA/RND",52

   For more information on  using both random and sequential  files, refer  to
   FIELD, GET, PUT, LSET, RSET, INPUT#, LINEINPUT#, and PRINT#.


PRINT# - Output data to a sequential file

   The PRINT# command will allow you to  output data to a sequential file. The
   syntax for the PRINT# command is:

     PRINT#buffer number,list of constants and/or expressions

   buffer number is the buffer used to open the file.  It may  be expressed as
   a numeric constant or a numeric expression.

   list  of constants and/or expressions  contains the  data that you  wish to
   output  to  the   file.  Numeric  constants,  numeric  expressions,  string
   constants and string expressions may all be contained  within this list. If
   more than  one value is  to  be output to  the  file using a  single PRINT#
   statement, these values must  be separated  by some type of delimiter.  The
   uses of delimiters in  a PRINT# command  will be explained  throughout this
   section.

   The PRINT#  command is  used in  conjunction with  any type  of  OPEN"O" or
   OPEN"E"  command.  After a file has been opened, data may  be output to the
   file  via the  PRINT#  command. Once  a file  has  been  created  using the
   OPEN"O"/OPEN"E"  and PRINT#  commands and then  closed,  the information in
   the file may be accessed using the OPEN11I" and INPUT#/LINEINPUT# commands.

   In  most cases,  data  written to  a sequential  file  is  stored  in ASCII
   format. For numeric  data, a  sign  byte will always  precede  the  numeric
   information. If the  value is positive,  the sign byte will be  represented
   by a  space.  A trailing space will always  follow the ASCII representation
   of the value.  Keeping  the above  in  mind,  the minimum  amount  of bytes
   required  to store a numeric value  in  a sequential  file is  3  (the sign
   byte, a digit, and the trailing space).

   For string data,  all  characters included in  the  string  value  will  be
   written to  the file, and  no  preceding  or  trailing  characters will  be
   written  to the file.  Special  considerations  do need  to be  taken  into
   account when writing string values to a  sequential file, as there are some
   peculiarities  involved with  the  INPUT#  command  when  trying to  access
   string information stored in  a sequential  file. These special cases  will
   be pointed out throughout this section.

   The  PRINT#  command resembles the PRINT command  in many ways with respect
   to how  information  is  physically  written  to  the  file.  Some  of  the
   punctuation  used in  the  PRINT# command will  cause data to be written to
   the  file  in much the  same  way that this punctuation causes  data to  be
   printed to the screen using the PRINT command.


   Punctuation is  very important when using the PRINT# command. The following
   will describe the punctuation which  is  allowed  with  the PRINT# command,
   and the effects of using different punctuation.

   Use of punctuation with the PRINT# command.

     Different  types of punctuation used to separate values to be output in a
     PRINT# statement will cause the  data  to  be  physically written  to the
     file  in  different  ways.  The  following  list  shows  the  punctuation
     required to separate values contained in a PRINT# statement.

       ,	- comma
       ;	- semicolon
       ","	- explicit comma

     When  separating output data contained in a PRINT# statement, you may use
     either a  comma or a semicolon.  A semicolon will cause the next piece of
     information  to be  written  directly  after the preceding data.  A comma
     will cause the next  piece  of  information to be  written  at  the  next
     available "tab"  position in the  file. Tab positions will  be denoted by
     16 byte blocks, starting  from the last occurrence  of a  carriage return
     (0DH) in the file.

     In some cases,  the explicit  comma is  used after string information has
     been  written to the disk, to demark the end of the string value from the
     beginning of the next piece of information to be written out.
     The following  examples will illustrate the methods used to write data to
     a sequential file, as well as the occurrences  that will result when this
     data is to be retrieved.

       Example 1 - Writing numeric data to a sequential file.

       Suppose  you  wish to  write two numeric  values  out to a  sequential
       file,  using one PRINT# command.  The file  you  wish to  write  these
       values Out to is  named DATA1/SEQ,  and has  been  opened using buffer
       number 2.  The variables  you  wish to write  out to the file  are A%,
       which  has  been  assigned a value  of  362,  and  B!, which  has been
       assigned a value of  -2618.7. The following PRINT# command may be used
       to write these values out to the file:

         PRINT#2,A%;B!

       The above  statement  will  cause  the values  362  and -2618.7  to be
       written to  the file in ASCII  format.  The image produced on the disk
       by this  PRINT# statement is shown  below.  (Note that throughout  the
       rest  of  this  section,  the  image produced  by the  example  PRINT#
       statements will  always  follow the PRINT# statement. The image  shown
       will be  similar to  the  LDOS  LIST  (H) library command; each  ASCII
       character will be displayed  with  its  corresponding hex value  shown
       below the character.)

	     3  6  2     -  2  6  1  8  .  7
	 20 33 36 32 20 2D 32 36 31 38 2E 37 20 0D


       Note  the  sign byte  preceding  each value,  and  the trailing  space
       following each  value. Also  note that the  last  byte written to  the
       file  is  a  carriage  return  (0DH). A carriage return will always be
       written to the file after the last item listed in a PRINT# statement.

       Realize that a  semicolon was used to separate the variables A% and B!
       in the PRINT# command. A comma could have been used  instead; however,
       the image of the  data on the disk would have changed to the following
       if a comma would have been used instead of a semicolon.

	      3  6  2
	  20 33 36 32 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20

	   -  2  6  1  8  .  7
	  2D 32 36 31 38 2E 37 20 0D

       Notice the series of spaces  following  the number 362.  These will be
       written to the disk as a result of a comma being used to separate  the
       variables A%  and  B!. As was  noted  earlier, when using  a comma  to
       separate variables in  a  PRINT#  statement, the value  following  the
       comma will be written to the next tab position  (the beginning byte of
       the next block  of 16 bytes). As  depicted in the above displays, much
       disk  space will  be  wasted in  writing  to  sequential  files if the
       values  in  a  PRINT#  statement are separated by  commas  instead  of
       semicolons.

       Example 2 - Writing string data to a sequential file.

       Suppose you  wish to write 3 string values  out  to a sequential file,
       using one PRINT# command. The file  you wish to write these values out
       to is  named DATA2/SEQ, and has been opened using buffer number I. The
       variables you wish to write  out  to the file are  A$  (which has been
       assigned the value "AMBER"), B$  (which  has  been assigned  the value
       "BROWN"),  and  the  string  constant  "GRAY".  The  following  PRINT#
       command may be used to write these values out to the file:

	 PRINT#1,A$;",";B$;",";"GRAY"

       The above statement will cause the  values "AMBER", "BROWN" and "GRAY"
       to  be written  to the file. The image  produced on  the disk  by this
       PRINT# statement is shown below.

	  A  M  B  E  R  ,  B  R  O  W  N  ,  G  R  A  Y
	 41 4D 42 45 52 2C 42 52 4F 57 4E 2C 47 52 41 59 0D

       There are many things to be noted  in this example. The most prominent
       of these  is the  use of the explicit comma (","). You will note  from
       the above display that along with the string  values, commas were also
       written  out to the file (since  they were enclosed  within quotes  as
       part of the list of values  to  be written  out). In most applications
       dealing with  writing strings out to  sequential files,  you will need
       to  incorporate  the explicit  comma within the  list of values  to be
       printed  out by the PRINT#. The  reason behind this stems from the way
       INPUT# deals with retrieving information from a sequential file.


       Before  continuing  with more examples on  the  use of PRINT#, a brief
       discussion of using INPUT# with files created by PRINT# is in order.


     How INPUT# ties together with PRINT#

       As shown throughout  this section, the punctuation  used in the PRINT#
       command is very important, and determines  the manner in  which INPUT#
       will  access this information.  INPUT# deals with  retrieving  numeric
       data in a different fashion than it does with string data.

       When  INPUT# requests  the  input of a numeric variable, it will begin
       reading from  the last accessed byte  in the file. Any  leading spaces
       that are encountered  will be ignored. Once INPUT# finds  a  non-space
       character, it will  read  until  it  encounters either a  space  or  a
       delimiter,  and the value assigned to  the variable will be determined
       by performing a VAL function  on the  characters  read in. This is  to
       say that any  characters may be input into a numeric variable, and the
       inputting  of string  values  into a numeric variable will not cause a
       TYPE MISMATCH error.

       When INPUT# requests  the input of a string  variable, it  will  begin
       reading from the last accessed  byte in the file, and proceed until it
       finds a non-space character.  Once it finds a non-space character,  it
       will read until it  encounters a delimiter, and  the value assigned to
       the variable will be  all characters read in from the  first non-space
       character  to the delimiter. Note from the above  description that any
       "leading" spaces  which  are present in  the data  file  for  the data
       element in  question will be ignored by INPUT#, and the value assigned
       to the string will never have leading spaces.

       In  all cases, when INPUT# requests an input of a variable, the  input
       will be terminated when a delimiter character is read  in. For numeric
       inputs, delimiters can be represented  by either a space,  a comma, or
       a carriage return (0DH). In most cases, a coma should not be  used as
       the delimiter for a numeric input.

       For string inputs,  a delimiter can be  represented by either a  comma
       or  a carriage return.  Realize that  for any input of  a variable, if
       the  number  of characters read in will exceed 255, the  input of  the
       variable will terminate after the 255th character has been accessed.

       One  point  to  note is  that in most cases,  two delimiter characters
       should not appear together in a sequential file. This occurrence  will
       cause  unpredictable results when trying to input information from the
       file.

       From  the above paragraphs, it can  be seen that  in  any one physical
       PRINT#  statement, if values are to be written Out following a  string
       value, they  must be separated from the  string  value  by use  of the
       explicit comma. The general format  which  is  recommended to  perform
       such a data write is as follows:

         PRINT#b,...;string value;",";next value;...


       Example 3 - Writing numeric and string data to a file.

       Suppose you wish to write several string and numeric values  out  to a
       sequential file using the  same PRINT# statement. The file you wish to
       write  these  values out to  is named DATA3/SEQ, and has  been  opened
       using buffer number 2. The string  values you wish  to write  Out  are
       contained  in  the variables  A$ (which has  been  assigned  the value
       "ANN"), B$ (which has  been assigned the  value "BETTY") and C$ (which
       has been  assigned the value "CAROL"). The numeric values  you wish to
       write Out  are contained in the  variables A% (which has been assigned
       a value of 20), B%  (which  has been  assigned a value of 32), and  C%
       (which  has been assigned  a value of 23). The following  will show  a
       PRINT# statement which  may  be  used to write these values out to the
       file, and the associated image that will be  written to the disk as  a
       result of performing the PRINT#.

       PRINT#2,A%;A$;" ,";B%;B$;",";C%;C$


	     2  0     A  N  N  ,     3  2     B  E  T  T
	 20 32 30 20 41 4E 4E 2C 20 33 32 20 42 45 54 54
	  Y  ,     2  3     C  A  R  O  L
	 59 2C 20 32 33 20 43 41 52 4F 4C 0D

       Please note from the above  example that no  explicit  comma  needs to
       follow numeric data. Also note that since  C$ is  the last variable to
       be written out  in  this PRINT# command,  no  explicit comma is needed
       after it, as a carriage return will always be written out to  the file
       after the  last variable  in  a  PRINT#  command. This carriage return
       will serve as the delimiter for subsequent PRINT# commands.


   This concludes  our discussion of  the PRINT# command.  It  is  recommended
   that  test files be created by the user in order to explore the results  of
   various PRINT# statements. After sequential  files have  been created, they
   may be  examined by use the LDOS LIST (H) command.  For further information
   see OPEN, INPUT#, and LINEINPUT#.


PRINT# USING - Output data to a sequential file using a specified format

   The PRINT#  USING command will allow  you to output  data to  a  sequential
   file using a specified format. The syntax for the PRINT# USING command is:

     PRINT#buffer number,USING format string;list of values

   buffer number is the buffer  used  to open the file. It may be expressed as
   a numeric constant or a numeric expression.

   format string  is the  format you wish to use to write the  list  of values
   out to  the  file. It may be represented as  either a string  constant or a
   string expression.


   list  of values is  the same  as  list of constants  and/or expressions  as
   defined in the PRINT# command.


   The PRINT# USING  command  will allow you to output  data  to a  sequential
   file in the format specified by the format string. Any  format string which
   is allowable in  the PRINT USING  command  will  also be  allowable  in the
   PRINT# USING command, and will  function in an identical manner.  For  more
   information  on  allowable format strings, refer to PRINT USING in the  ROM
   Basic manual. (For  more information on the specifics  involved  in writing
   information out to a sequential file, see PRINT#.)

     Example

	Suppose you wish to write  three numeric values  out  to  a sequential
	file. The name  of the  file is DATA/SEQ, and it has been opened using
	buffer number 1. The values you  wish  to write  out are  contained in
	the variables  A% (which has  been assigned a value of 25),  B! (which
	has been assigned a value of  13.73),  and C% (which has been assigned
	a value of -17). The format  string you wish to use  has been assigned
	to the variable A$, and has the value:

			    ###	####.###  ####

        The following  will show a PRINT#  USING  command that may  be used to
        write  out the above values, and the disk image created  by the PRINT#
        USING command.

          PRINT#1 ,USINGA$;A%,BI ,C%

              2  5                    1  3  .  7  3  0           -  1  7
          20 32 35 20 20 20 20 20 20 31 33 2E 37 33 30 20 20 20 2D 31 37 0D


	Note from the  above example that the image  created on  disk conforms
	to the format string specified.  Unlike the PRINT# command, the use of
	delimiters to separate the  values to  be printed  out  is  arbitrary.
	That is to  say,  there  is no  difference  in  using  a  comma  as  a
	delimiter as opposed to a semicolon.


PUT - Write a record out to a random file

   The PUT command is used  to  write  information  out to a random  file. The
   information  that is to be written out  to the file  must  have been placed
   into the buffer that  was used to  open the file prior to being written out
   to the file. The syntax for the PUT command is:

     PUT#,r
     PUT#

   where # is  the  buffer  number used to open the file,  and r is the record
   number you  wish to  retrieve. Both # and  r may  be numeric  constants  or
   numeric expressions.


   If  the  record  number (r)  is  not specified,  the  computer  will  first
   increment the current record number by  one,  after which it will perform a
   PUT of  the current  record number. If  no current  record number  has been
   established, the  computer will perform a PUT of record number one, and the
   current record number will be set equal to one.

     Example

	Suppose you wish  to output data  to a random  file. The file you wish
	to perform the output to  has the  name FILE/RND, and has been fielded
	using buffer  number 2. The record you wish  to write  out to the file
	is record number 23.  Assume also that all of the  values you wish  to
	write  out  to the  file have been placed  into  the  buffer using the
	proper LSET  and RSET commands. One of the  following PUT commands may
	be used to write the information to the 23rd record of the file.

   	   PUT2,23
	   N%=1:N1%=30:PUTN%+1,N1%-7

	After executing one  of the above statements, the  information  stored
	in the  buffer  associated  with the file FILE/RND will be written out
	to the disk, and  will be placed in  the file as representing the 23rd
	record in the file. Once  this information has  been placed  into  the
	file, it may be retrieved using the GET command.

	For more information on using PUT, see OPEN, FIELD, LSET and RSET.

RSET - Place data into the buffer assigned to an open file

   The RSET  command  will  allow  you to  place information  into  the buffer
   associated with a disk file,  prior to  writing this information out to the
   disk. It  is  used primarily in conjunction with random files.  The  syntax
   for the RSET command is:

     RSET fielded string variable=value

   fielded string  variable is the variable used  in  the field statement that
   points to the location in the buffer where the data is to be placed.

   value  is the  value  that you  wish to  place in the buffer, and must be a
   string constant or string expression.

   The  RSET  command  functions identically to  the  LSET command,  with  the
   following exception.  Rather than  the information  being  placed  into the
   buffer  left-justified,  RSET  will  place the information into the  buffer
   right justified. If the length of the string  to be  placed into the buffer
   is  less than  the fielded  length  of the particular  slot  of the buffer,
   spaces will be inserted  in front  of the string  in the buffer to make the
   string in the buffer the same length as specified in the field statement.

   If the length of  the string to be RSET into the buffer is greater than the
   fielded  length, the right  most part of the string  will be placed in  the
   buffer, and  any characters  to the  left of the total allocated space will
   be truncated.


   For more information on how to utilize the RSET  command  and the functions
   it performs, refer to the LSET command.

RUN - Load a Basic program from disk and execute it

   The RUN  command will allow you  to  load  an LBASIC program stored on disk
   into  the  computer's  memory,  and immediately  begin  execution  of  that
   program. The syntax for the RUN command is:

     RUN"filespec",file/variable parameter,line number

   filespec  is  the name of the  program  that  you  wish  to  be  loaded and
   executed, and may be  represented by any  valid LDOS filespec. filespec may
   be either  a string  constant or a  string  expression.  If filespec is not
   included, the program currently in memory will be executed.

   file/variable parameter  is an  optional parameter,  and is  used primarily
   when  LBASIC programs are to  be "chained"  together. One of two  different
   parameters are available. If the  parameter R is used,  any files which are
   currently  open  will  remain  open  when  the new  program  is  loaded and
   executed   If the parameter V is used, all open files will remain open, and
   all variable  assignments will be maintained. This parameter, if used, must
   be represented as a letter (R or V), and cannot appear within  quote marks,
   or cannot be represented by a string expression.

   line number is an optional  parameter, and is used to specify a line number
   in the program  where execution is to  start.  If not specified,  execution
   will  begin with  the first  line  number  of the new  program.  It must be
   represented as a numeric constant.

   The RUN  command may be issued  from  the  Basic READY prompt  to  load and
   execute a program, or may be  used from within an LBASIC program to perform
   a chaining  of programs.  If the  RUN command is given with a filespec, any
   program which is currently resident in memory  will be overwritten, and the
   program specified in the RUN command will be loaded and executed.

   If the  RUN  command  is  given  with  just a  filespec (i.e. no additional
   parameters  are  specified),  no variables  will  be retained, and any open
   files will be closed.

   If the RUN command  is given with the  R  parameter, all  variables will be
   lost, but any files which were  opened will remain open,  and will  utilize
   the same buffer number. Realize that  if  the R parameter is used, any open
   files must be re-fielded.

   If  the  RUN  command is  given  with  the  V  parameter,  any  established
   variables will be maintained,  and all open  files  will remain open. There
   are  several  points  to  be  considered  when using  the  V  parameter. In
   addition  to  all  files  remaining  open,  the  fielding  of  the   buffer
   associated with the open file will  remain intact.  Hence,  re-fielding  is
   not required. Any  DEFinition statements (such  as DEFINT  and DEFSTR) must
   be  re-established in the program to be chained.  The  CLEAR command should
   not  be  encountered in the program to be chained, as execution of  a CLEAR
   statement will close all open files and destroy any established variables.


   It should be obvious to the  user  that if  the  program  to be chained  is
   longer than  the  calling program, or  uses more variables than the calling
   program, an  OUT OF  MEMORY or OUT  OF  STRING SPACE  error  may occur.  To
   utilize this feature to its fullest  capabilities, forethought must go into
   the  determination of variable names to be carried over from one program to
   another.

   If  the  RUN command is  given with the line number  parameter, the program
   specified  will be loaded, and execution will begin at the line  specified.
   Realize that  the line number specified must be an existing line number, or
   an UNDEFINED LINE NUMBER error will be generated.

   The R/V  and line number parameters  may be specified individually, or they
   may appear together in the RUN command.  If both  parameters are specified,
   the R/V parameter must physically come before the line number parameter.


     Example 1

	Suppose you have an LBASIC program  named MYPROG/BAS, and this program
	has been saved  onto a disk which is currently  in drive 1. One of the
	following  commands  may  be  given  to  load  and execute  the  above
	program.

  	  RUN"MYPROG/BAS:1"
	  A$="MYPROG/BAS:1":RUN A$


	After  either  of  the  above   commands  are  executed,  any  program
	currently in  memory will be  overwritten, and the program  MYPROG/BAS
	will  be loaded  and executed. Any open files  will be closed, and any
	established variables will be destroyed.


     Example 2

	Suppose  you  wish  to  load  and  execute  the program MYPROG/BAS  as
	described in  the  above example,  except that  you wish  execution to
	begin at line 3000 in  the program.  The  following command will cause
	the program to be loaded) and execution will begin at line 3000.

	  RUN"MYPROG/BAS:1",3000


     Example 3

	This example will illustrate how to  use the  V  parameter of the  RUN
	command to maintain variables between  chained programs. Listed  below
	will  be  two  programs  that  reference  each  other  (PROG1/BAS  and
	PROG2/BAS). The  sequence  will  be started  by  issuing  the  command
	RUN"PROG1/BAS". Realize  that both programs  must  have  been saved on
	disk prior to trying to execute either.


	  5 'PROG1/BAS
	  10 CLEAR 2000
	  20 DEFINTA-Z:DEFSTRS
	  30 IF A=0 THEN S="PROG1/BAS"
	  40 CLS
	  50 A=A+5
	  60 PRINT"THIS IS ";S,"A=";A
	  70 IF A>100 THEN END
	  80 S="PROG2/BAS"
	  90 INPUT"PRESS <ENTER> TO RUN PROG2/BAS";S1
	  100 RUN"PROG2/BAS",V,20



	  5 'PROG2/BAS
	  10 CLEAR 2000
	  20 DEFINTA-Z:DEFSTRS
	  30 CLS
	  40 A=A+3
	  50 PRINT"THIS IS ";S,"A=";A
	  60 S="PROG1/BAS"
	  70 INPUT"PRESS <ENTER> TO RUN PROG1/BAS";S1
	  80 RUN"PROG1/BAS",V,20

	Notice  that in each  of  the RUN commands, the  line  number  20  was
	specified. This accomplishes two things. It  causes execution to start
	at line  20 of each  program, which will  cause the  CLEAR  command in
	both  programs to be bypassed. Also,  line 20 must be executed, as all
	DEF type  statements must be re-established when programs  are chained
	using the V parameter. Although this  is a very simplistic example, it
	should  illustrate  some  of  the  steps  needed  to  perform  program
	chaining while retaining variable assignments.


SAVE - Save the LBASIC program resident in memory to disk

   The SAVE command will allow you to save the program currently  in memory to
   a disk file. This will allow  you to store programs on disk for future use.
   The syntax for the SAVE command is:

     SAVE" filespec",A

   filespec is the file specification you wish to assign to the  program file.
   It may be represented as either a string constant or a string expression.

   the  A parameter is  an optional  parameter. If  used, the program will  be
   saved out  to the  file in pure ASCII format. If not specified, the program
   will be saved out to the file in "compressed" format.

   As  LBASIC programs are being written or edited, they  are contained in the
   computer's memory. The  SAVE command provides a way to save LBASIC programs
   which  are stored  in memory out  to  a  disk  file,  so  that they  may be
   referenced at some later time via the LOAD or RUN command.


   When  the  SAVE  command is given,  one of  two things  will happen. If the
   filespec  in  the SAVE command represents  a non-existing  file, SAVE  will
   create a  file  with the filename, extension,  and password specified,  and
   store in this file the Basic program  currently  in memory. If the filespec
   in  the  SAVE  command  represents  an  already existing  file,  SAVE  will
   overwrite the existing file with the program in memory.

   When the A parameter is  not  specified in a SAVE command,  the  program in
   memory  will  be  saved  to  a  disk  file  in  its  compressed form  (i.e.
   compression codes will  be used to represent  the LBASIC commands and  line
   numbers).  If the A parameter is specified in a  SAVE command, the  program
   will  be saved to the disk file in pure  ASCII (e.g. the command PRINT will
   take up five bytes of disk storage, one byte for each character).

   Note: When  using the A parameter to save a program, no line in the program
   should exceed 240 characters in  length.  If a program  is saved with the A
   parameter and a line  in the  program is  longer than 240  characters,  the
   program will load up to  the line which is longer  than 240 characters, and
   the rest  of  the program will be  inaccessible. A Direct Statement in File
   error will also be generated.


   It should be  obvious that saving a program in ASCII will consume more disk
   space than  saving  the  same  program in  compressed  form,  but there are
   certain situations where a program must be saved in  ASCII. One case  where
   you have to save  a program in ASCII is if you wish to perform a MERGE of a
   Basic  program  stored on disk with a  program  currently  in  memory.  The
   program to be  merged in from  disk  must  have been saved in ASCII, or the
   merge will abort with an error.

   The SAVE command  may be given either from the  LBASIC Ready prompt, or may
   be incorporated as  a  command within a program. If used within a  program,
   the program will SAVE itself, after which normal execution will continue.


     Example

        Suppose  you  have  keyed in a Basic  program,  and wish to  save this
        program out to  a disk file. The  drive you wish to store this file on
        is drive  1,  and  the  name  you  wish  to assign  to  this  file  is
        GOODPROG/BAS.  One  SAVE command  that  may be used to accomplish this
        might look like this:

          SAVE"GOODPROG/BAS:1"

        If  you  wish to save  this program in ASCII,  the  following  command
        could be used:

          FS$="GOODPROG/BAS":SAVE FS$,A

        Note  in the  above example that  the  filespec  was represented as  a
        string  variable. Also note  that the A  parameter must  appear  as  a
        literal constant, and cannot be expressed as a string expression.


SET EOF - Reset end of file marker to "shrink" the size of a random file

   The SET EOF command may be used  to "shrink" the  amount of space  taken up
   by a file, and thus free-up additional disk  space. The syntax for the  SET
   EOF command is:

      SET EOFn

   n represents the  buffer number used to open the  file in question, and can
   be expressed as an integer constant or an integer expression.

   The SET  EOF command is used primarily in conjunction with random files. In
   some applications,  a  random file  may contain unwanted records at the end
   of  the file. The SET  EOF command will furnish you with a way to eliminate
   these  unwanted records. The  function  it performs  is to reset the end of
   file marker for the file in question to  a value  less than the current end
   of  file  marker.  This will cause all records  whose  record  numbers  are
   greater than the new end of file marker value to be ignored,  and thus make
   these records inaccessible. Also, the space taken up on  the  disk by these
   "eliminated"  records will be added  to  the free space available, and thus
   may be reused.

   To use the SET EOF  command, you must open the file in question as a random
   file.  It is  highly recommended that the  record length used  to  open the
   file be the same as the record length used for normal access to the file.

   After the file has been  opened, perform a GET of the record you wish to be
   the last record in the file.  You may then use the SET EOF command to reset
   the end of  file  marker to the current record number,  and  thus eliminate
   all  unwanted  records  (by doing a GET, the current  record number will be
   changed to the value of the record which was retrieved).

     Example

	Suppose  you  have  a  random  file  named  XTRA/DAT  which  currently
	contains 100 records, and you wish to eliminate  the last  50  records
	of the file  (records  5l-l00). Assume also  that  the  file has  been
	opened  in  the  random mode, using  buffer  number  3. The  following
	commands may be used to accomplish this "file shrinkage".

           GET3,50:SET EOF3

				     NOTE

	Be extremely careful when  using the  SET  EOF  command.  Once records
	have been  eliminated from  a file using this  command, they might not
	be recoverable!! It  is  beyond  the scope  of  this manual to discuss
	techniques  used  to recover lost  information  in  a file.  The  best
	prevention for such an occurrence is caution!

TIME$ - Return the date and time as a string

   The TIME$ command will retrieve the  current date and time (as kept  by the
   real time clock) as a string. The syntax for the TIME$ command is:


     TIME$

   The value  returned from the TIME$ command  can be used in a similar manner
   as the value returned from the  MEM command. It may be used directly (as in
   the statement PRINT TIME$), or  may be assigned to a string variable (as in
   A$=TIME$).  The  value returned by the  TIME$ command will always  be  a 17
   character string, and will be defined by the following format:

     mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss

   mm,  dd,  and  yy  represent  the  month,   day  of  the  month,  and  year
   respectively,  as  kept  by  the  operating  system.  The  hh, mm,  and  ss
   represent  the  hours   (00-23),  minutes   (00-59)  and   seconds  (00-59)
   respectively, as retrieved from the real time clock  when the TIME$ command
   was actually executed.  The slashes ("/") and colons  (":")  will always be
   present  in  the  string,  and  a  space  will  always  separate  the  date
   information from the time information.

USR - Execute a user written machine language subroutine.

   The USR command will  allow an LBASIC program  to branch to a  user written
   machine language subroutine. The syntax for the USR command is:

     variable=USRn(integer value)

   variable  must be  a  numeric  variable,  and  in most  cases should be  of
   integer  type.  If  a  value  is to  be  returned from the machine language
   subroutine,  it may be contained in this variable when the machine language
   routine returns to LBASIC.

   n is  the  user  routine  number (0-9) used  to  identify  the  routine  in
   question (user routines are defined with  the DEFUSR command).  The routine
   number must be represented as a numeric constant.

   integer value is a  value which will be passed to the user machine language
   subroutine. It may  be  represented  as a  numeric  expression or a numeric
   constant, and must be expressed as an integer value.


   The  USR  command will allow you  to jump to a machine language  subroutine
   from  within  your Basic  program. The  machine  language  subroutine  will
   generally be resident  in  high  memory, and the  memory used by the module
   must  be  protected,  either  using  the  MEMORY  Library  command,  or  by
   specifying the MEM parameter when entering LBASIC.

   Prior to issuing  a USR call, the starting address of the  specific machine
   language subroutine must have been defined using the DEFUSR command.

   Once the  USR  call is  performed,  execution of your Basic program will be
   halted,  and  a  jump  will  be  done  to  the  address  specified  in  the
   corresponding DEFUSR statement. Your  machine language subroutine will then
   take over, until a  return to Basic is  performed in  the machine  language
   module. Once  this return to Basic has been encountered, your Basic program
   will regain control.


	Example 1 - Initiating a USR call

	Suppose you have loaded  and protected a machine  language  module. In
	addition,  you  have  defined  this  machine  language module with the
	following command:

  	  DEFUSR5=&HF400

	To perform  a  jump to  this  machine  language module,  the following
	command may be given:

	  XX%=USR5(1024)

	Upon executing the above  command, execution of the Basic program will
	be halted,  and the  machine language  instruction  at address X'F400'
	will  be  executed.  The value  1024 will be  passed  to  the  machine
	language routine.  The machine  language routine will continue  to  be
	executed, until a return to  Basic is encountered. If  any value is to
	be returned from the  subroutine, it will be contained in the  integer
	variable XX% when Basic regains control.

	Example 2 - Passing values to and from machine language subroutines

	In  the  above  example,  the value  1024  was  passed to the  machine
	language   subroutine.   In  order  to   utilize  this  value  in  the
	subroutine,  the  first  statement  of the  machine  language  routine
	should be the following:

	  CALL 0A7FH

	Executing  the above command as the first  statement  in  the  machine
	language subroutine will cause the  value 1024 to  be placed in the HL
	register, with H containing the MSB, and  L  containing the LSB of the
	value.

	To  return a value from a  machine language subroutine  to  Basic, you
	should  use  the following  command  as  the  last  statement in  your
	subroutine:

	  JP 0A9AH

	After  your  machine  language  module  executes  the  above  command,
	control will  return to Basic (the statement following the USR  call),
	and  the variable used in the USR call will be assigned the value that
	was in  the HL register pair prior to the JP command. If  no  value is
	to  be returned from  your machine language module, you  may use a RET
	command to return to Basic.


CMD"N"  -  LBASIC PROGRAM RENUMBERING

This LBASIC feature will renumber LBASIC  program line numbers as well as  all
line references such as GOSUB and GOTO. The syntax is:

	 ===============================================================
	 |  CMD"N I aaaa,bbbb,cccc,dddd"                               |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  !     optional parameter to skip the complete scan         |
	 |        for errors before renumbering begins.                |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  aaaa  line number of the current program to start the      |
	 |        renumbering from.                                    |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  bbbb  new line number for line aaaa.                       |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  cccc  increment between line numbers.                      |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  dddd  the last line number to be renumbered.               |
	 |                                                             |
	 ===============================================================


Both LBASIC/CMD and LBASIC/OV1 must be present on the disk,  or a "Program Not
Found" error will occur.

You cannot have a line number zero (0) if renumbering an LBASIC program.

This renumber feature  will  allow you to renumber all or parts of  the LBASIC
program currently  in memory. The lines  to be renumbered  can be  anywhere in
the  program.  However,  if  the  parameters  you  use  would  result  in  the
renumbered lines being out of sequence, a BAD PARAMETERS error will occur.

If  you do not specify the exclamation point  (!) character, a  full scan  for
errors will be done  before the  renumbering  starts. If  errors  do exist, no
lines will be changed. It is usually much easier  to fix the errors before the
lines are renumbered!

If you do specify the !, any error found  will  still abort  the  renumbering.
However, all  internal line number references will  have already  been changed
up to  the line that cause  the error.  Do  not use the ! parameter unless you
are absolutely sure that no errors exist.

The default values for the line and increment parameters are as follows:

aaaa	= 1
bbbb	= 20
cccc	= 20
dddd	= 65529


CMD"X"  -  LBASIC CROSS REFERENCE

This  LBASIC  feature will produce  a cross  reference of variables  and  line
numbers for your LBASIC program currently in memory. The syntax is:

	 ===============================================================
	 |  CMD"X devspec/filespec  parameter,<title>"                 |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  devspec/filespec is the device or file the listing will    |
	 |  be sent to. If not specified, it will go to the screen.    |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  parameter specifies Variables or Lines as follows:         |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  -V         all Variables.                                  |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  =variable  only the variable specified.                    |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  -L         all Line numbers.                               |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  =number    only the line number specified.                 |
	 |                                                             |
	 |                                                             |
	 |  <title>  an optional title to be printed on the top        |
	 |           of each page.                                     |
	 |                                                             |
	 ===============================================================


Both LBASIC/CMD  and LBASIC/OV2  must be present  on  a disk or a "Program Not
Found" error will occur.

You cannot have a line number zero (0) if you wish to  use the cross reference
utility.

This cross reference feature will allow you to produce a list of the  variable
and line number references of  an LBASIC program. This list may be sent to any
device in  the system, such as  the  *DO  (video screen),  *PR (line printer),
etc. It may also be sent directly to a specified disk file.

Parameters are  allowed to determine which variables or line  numbers will  be
listed.  If no parameter is specified, all variables and  line numbers will be
cross referenced.

If  you wish a title  to be put on the top of every page in the  list, it must
be specified between less-than/greater-than symbols in the command line.


L B A S I C    E R R O R    D I C T I O N A R Y

Incorporated in ROM Basic  are various error messages and  error codes.  These
error codes are provided for the user  so that certain types of errors may  be
"trapped" for, and  the execution of the Basic program in question will not be
interrupted. As  pointed  out in the ROM  Basic manual, the user may determine
the exact nature of an error by utilizing the ERR and ERL commands.

Because many  new commands are included in LBASIC  which are not a part of ROM
Basic, LBASIC will have in its  error dictionary new error  codes (disk  error
codes),  along with the error codes found  in ROM Basic.  The error dictionary
for LBASIC is contained  in the file LBASIC/OV3.  For  this reason, LBASIC/OV3
must always be present on a disk in the system when programming in Basic.

This  part of the manual will list the disk error codes and messages, and will
include a brief description of each error. The  user  should realize  that the
descriptions  given for each error are not all  inclusive. That is to say, the
example circumstances  given for  a particular  error  may  not  encompass all
circumstances which could generate the error in question.

Before we begin giving these disk error codes,  a few general points should be
made. LBASIC's error  dictionary is not as large as the error dictionary found
in LDOS. For this reason, several different  types of  disk related errors may
produce the same LBASIC error message. To  pinpoint the exact nature of a disk
related error, it  may be  beneficial to  determine the LDOS interpretation of
an error.  After a disk related error occurs, you may determine the associated
LDOS  error message by  performing a  CMD"E".  This may be  useful  when,  for
instance, you get  the LBASIC error  message  "Disk  I/O  Error",  as  several
different occurrences  may  cause this  type of  error.  For more information,
refer to CMD"E".

All error codes given  in this manual  will be the value  returned  by the ERR
command. In your ROM Basic  manual,  the error codes given  may  be derived by
the value of ERR/2 or ERR/2+1. If you wish  your LBASIC program to  conform to
these conventions, the error codes listed here must be adjusted accordingly.


Error 100 ----------- Field Overflow

   The Field Overflow error  indicates that the number of bytes fielded for  a
   random  file exceeds the record  length of  the file  (as specified  in the
   OPEN statement).


Error 102 ----------- Internal Error

   An  Internal  Error  will  occur  when the  error  in  question  cannot  be
   interpreted. One  way  an Internal Error  may be  generated is  to issue  a
   CMD"L" command, and the file to be loaded is not found.


Error 104 ----------- Bad File Number

   A  Bad File Number error will occur  when a file is opened using an illegal
   buffer number (a  buffer  number  greater than  the  total number  of files
   specified when  entering  LBASIC),  or  fielding a  buffer  which  does not
   correspond to an open random file.


Error 106 ----------- File Not Found

   A  File Not Found error  indicates that the file being referenced does  not
   exist.  This   error  may  occur  after  an  OPEN"I',  OPEN"EO",  OPEN"OO",
   OPEN"RO", LOAD or RUN command has been issued.


Error 108 ----------- Bad File Mode

   A  Bad  File Mode error indicates that a file is being accessed improperly.
   This may occur when, for instance, you  try  to access a file  opened as  a
   random  file  in  a sequential manner  (i.e. issue  an INPUT# command after
   opening a file in the random mode).


Error 110 ----------- File Already Open

   A File Already  Open  error will be  generated  when you try to OPEN a file
   using  a buffer  that corresponds  to an already open  file.  Note  that no
   error will be generated  if  the same file  is in  an  open state using two
   different buffers at the same time (This practice is NOT advised).


Error 114 ----------- Disk I/O Error

   A Disk I/O Error will occur when an  input from or an output to a disk file
   is unsuccessful. A typical LDOS error message which is  associated with the
   Disk I/O Error is a Parity Error.


Error 116 ----------- File Already Exists

   A  File  Already Exists  error  will  be  generated when using  an OPEN"xN"
   command if the file already exists.


Error 122 ----------- Disk Full

   A Disk Full error will  indicate that  all of  the free space on a disk has
   been consumed. In some cases) the occurrence of a disk becoming full  (i.e.
   all of the disk space  being  consumed) may generate a Disk Write Protected
   error.


Error 124 ----------- Input Past End

   The  Input Past End  error applies  only  to  sequential  files opened  for
   input, and will  occur when a read of the file is  attempted after all data
   in the file has been input.


Error 126 ----------- Bad Record Number

   A Bad Record Number error  will be  issued  when  record  number 0 (or some
   other illegal record number) is accessed in a random file.


Error 128 ----------- Bad File Name

   A Bad  File Name  error will  be generated  when  the file  specified in an
   OPEN,  SAVE, LOAD,  RUN or  MERGE  command  does not  conform  to the rules
   governing valid LDOS filespecs.


Error 132 ----------- Direct Statement in File

   A Direct  Statement  in  File  error  will  be  generated  when  a  LOAD is
   performed  of  a file that is not an LBASIC program (usually when a LOAD of
   a data  file is attempted). This type of error  will also be generated when
   an  LBASIC program which was saved in ASCII is  loaded, and  a line  in the
   program exceeds 240 characters in length.


Error 134 ----------- Too Many Files

   The Too Many Files error will occur when an  attempt is made to add another
   extent  to a file when all  directory  entries have been used. This type of
   error will be very uncommon.


Error 136 ----------- Disk Write Protected

   A Disk  Write  Protected error  usually  indicates that  a  write  has been
   attempted to  a  write protected  disk.  Other  types  of errors  may  also
   generate  a  Disk  Write Protected error.  If the disk  in  question is not
   write protected, use CMD"E" to determine the exact error.


Error 138 ----------- File Access Denied

   A File Access Denied error may be  generated when a password protected file
   (either  a  data  file or a program file) is  referenced using an incorrect
   password.


Error 140 ----------- Blocked File Error

   A Blocked File Error will occur if you attempt to OPEN a random  file  with
   an  LRL of  other  than  256  after  entering  LBASIC  and  specifying  the
   parameter BLK=OFF.


Error 142 ----------- System Command Aborted

   A System Command Aborted error will occur  if an LDOS command called by the
   CMD"command" function is manually aborted.


Error 144 ----------- Protection Has Cleared Memory

   The Protection Has Cleared Memory error  will be generated if an attempt is
   made to illegally access an EXECute only program without  using the  proper
   password. The program and variables will be cleared from memory.
